I did not want to go to the White House.  I was offered jobs,” Cohen claimed. \\n\\n  “I can tell you a story of Mr.  Trump reaming out (former White House Chief of Staff) Reince Priebus because I had not taken a job where Mr.  Trump wanted me to, which was working with (former White House Counsel) Don McGahn in the White House Counsel office,” Cohen continued.  “What I said at the time – and I brought a lawyer in who produced a memo as to why I should not go in because there would be no attorney-client privilege – and in order to handle some of the matters I talked about in my opening that it would be best suited for me not to go in and the every President had a personal attorney. ”\\n\\n  Priebus provided no comment to CNN regarding Cohen’s claim.  \\n\\n  Cohen, later in his testimony, told Congress that he saw with Trump and an attorney to discuss staying on as Trump’s personal attorney following the inauguration. \\n\\n  “I did not want to go to the White House,” Cohen reasserted.  “I retained, I brought an attorney in, and I sat with Mr.  Trump, with him for well over an hour, explaining the importance of having a personal attorney, that every president has had one in order to handle matters like the matters I was dealing with. ”\\n\\n  However, over the last year, sources have told CNN that Cohen wanted a job at the White House but was edged out by Trump’s family. \\n\\n  Cohen was named personal attorney to the President in a bid to mollify him after he was not offered a position at the White House, sources familiar with the matter said.  But there is no indication he performed any legal work for Trump after he was inaugurated and he was not a member of the legal team representing him in the special counsel’s investigation. \\n\\n  Cohen on Wednesday provided Congress checks that were given to him over a “retainer” period, one of which was signed by Trump.  But Cohen conceded that there was no retainer agreement for his legal services, and the retainer payments were, in part, reimbursements for payments to Stephanie Clifford, known also as Stormy Daniels, who was compensated as part of a hush agreement over an alleged affair between Daniels and Trump. \\n\\n  In addition, several people familiar told CNN that Cohen told associates he believed he could be named White House chief of staff.  Cohen was crushed when he was not offered the job, which went to Priebus, the sources said. \\n\\nCNN reported in May that Trump’s daughter, Ivanka Trump and Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, sought to keep Cohen away from a White House job, and he was rarely seen there following the inauguration.  The proximity that Cohen initially had to Trump during the transition greatly weakened after Inauguration Day, multiple people told CNN at the time.   One person described Cohen as having become “disenfranchised” in the early months of the Trump administration – but that he nevertheless continued to portray himself as Trump’s go-to guy. \\n\\n  The President’s sons, Donald Trump Jr.  and Eric Trump, also disputed Cohen’s claim that he did not want a White House job.  \\n\\n  “Michael was lobbying EVERYONE to be ‘Chief of Staff. ’ It was the biggest joke in the campaign and around the office.  Did he just perjure himself again? ” Eric Trump asked on Twitter Wednesday morning.  \\n\\n  Donald Trump Jr.  responded, writing that Eric “nailed it. ” \\n\\n  “It really was the biggest joke of the entire transition.  The beginning of his bitterness was when he realized that was never going to happen.  #Delusional,” he continued. \\n\\nCNN’s Dana Bash, Elizabeth Hartfield, Kaitlan Collins, Jeremy Diamond, Evan Perez and Daniella Diaz contributed to this report. \\n© 2021 Cable News Network.

Edited Excerpts:There was major meeting of opposition chief ministers and Congress chief Sonia Gandhi on Wednesday.  The decision to hold the NEET and JEE exams has clearly become a major political issue. It pains to see that education is becoming politicised.  I request my colleagues across the political spectrum to abide by the orders of the honourable Supreme Court.  Leaving the politics aside, I would like to share that, a total of 7. 41 lakh candidates out of 8. 58 lakh appearing for JEE have downloaded admit cards.  Only 332 candidates have requested for change of their centre cities, which are being considered positively.  In reference to NEET, a total of 6. 84 lakh candidates (out of a total of 15. 97 lakh) have downloaded the admit cards in the first five hours.  West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee has said that if you don’t understand students’ problems, and that they will approach the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court, while dismissing the writ petition regarding the postponement of these examinations, also observed, inter alia, the following: “Ultimately life has to go on, and the career of the students cannot be put on peril for long and a full academic year cannot be wasted”.  I would like to state that Parliament will start functioning, offices are functioning.  In my opinion we have to ensure that there is no zero academic year in the lives of students.  Some students say that the government isn’t being considerate, and it isn’t responding to an unprecedented situation and the plight of students. I feel that this government is very empathetic and considerate to the cause of the students.  Academic career is very important, and a zero academic year will cause tremendous loss to the students. Every day, I get innumerable mails from the silent majority .  The parents and students say that they are under stress and preparing for exams for the last two to three years and that they don’t want a zero academic year.  They have been seriously preparing for the exams since January and the past two years.  My request to all parents and students is to have faith in us about the safety of the examination centres.  Is it not possible to move the exams ahead by another 30 or 60 days?  Are you considering any such move? There is no certainty about when the pandemic will.  The solution therefore is to move on with precautions.  Why is there no other alternative being considered -- online entrance examinations, or normalising of marks from different board exams to facilitate direct selection? We need to have a transparent system of selection of students into the higher education system.  The most transparent system is an objective test, and this has evolved over the years.  If we tinker with the system and selection process, it is going to cause irreparable damage to the careers of the students.  I have always reiterated that safety first and then exams.  But conducting these exams any time later might lead to a situation where the entire year could be lost, therefore conducting these exams in now with due precautions is a middle path.  What about students who don’t get centres of their choice -- how will they travel to the exam centre with transport and travel restrictions in various places? In the best interest of students, NTA has ensured that more than 99% candidates get their first choice of centre and cities in of these examinations.  The number of centres have been increased from 570 to 660 (in case of JEE Main) and 2,546 to 3,843 (in case of NEET).  In case of JEE Main, the number of shifts has been increased from the earlier 8 to 12, and the number of candidates per shift has been reduced from earlier 1. 32 lakh to 85,000. Can you give details of how these safety measures were arrived at? NTA has defined a SOP based on recommendations of a high-level committee of medical experts, along with in adherence to various Government directives and Guidelines issues from time to time by the government. \",\n  \"document_ocr\": \"ht exclusive\\nI get innumerable mails from the\\nsilent majority.

The hospital is located on Bharuch-Jambusar highway, nearly 200 km from Ahmedabad.

It did not elaborate on where or when the alleged leader of the opposition royalist group known as the Kingdom Assembly of Iran, or Tondar (Farsi for Thunder), was detained. Iran slammed its arch enemy the United States for hosting Sharmahd and “supporting known terrorists who have claimed responsiblity for several terrorist acts inside” the country. “This regime must answer for its support of this terrorist group and other groups and criminals who orchestrate armed, sabotage and terrorist operations against the people of Iran from inside America and spill Iranians’ blood,” a foreign ministry statement said. The intelligence ministry said Sharmahd had orchestrated the April 12, 2008 bombing in a packed mosque in Shiraz that killed 14 people and wounded 215. A US State Department spokesperson said “the Iranian regime has a long history of detaining Iranians and foreign nationals on spurious charges”. “We urge Iran to be fully transparent and abide by all international legal standards. ”Mosque bombing Iran hanged three men convicted of the bombing in 2009, saying they had ties to the monarchist group. The three men said they had been taking orders from an Iranian US-backed “CIA agent” identified at the time only as “Jamshid” to try to assassinate a high-ranking official in Iran, Fars news agency reported at the time. They were 21-year-old Mohsen Eslamian and Ali Asghar Pashtar, 20 -- both university students -- as well as Rouzbeh Yahyazadeh, 32. The three were found guilty of being “mohareb” (enemies of God) and “corruption on earth” by a revolutionary court in Tehran. Iran in 2010 hanged two other convicted members of the group, who had “confessed to obtaining explosives and planning to assassinate officials”. The statement issued on Saturday said that Tondar had plotted several other “big operations” which failed. It said that Tondar had planned to blow up a dam in Shiraz, use “cyanide bombs” at a Tehran book fair, and plant an explosive device at the mausoleum of the Islamic republic’s founder, the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. Iran’s intelligence ministry published a picture later on Saturday of a grey-haired man in a blindfold it said was Sharmahd.  It did not say where or when the photo was taken. ‘Complicated operation’It was not clear how Iran arrested Sharmahd, who has generally been based in the US, in what its intelligence ministry called a “complicated operation”. According to the association’s website, Sharmahd was born in Tehran in 1955 and grew up in an Iranian-German family before moving to the United States in 2003, where he started to voice anti-Islam and anti-Islamic republic statements. Tondar rejects the Iranian political system and campaigns to overthrow the Islamic republic and re-establish a monarchy similar to that of Cyrus the Great. Iran announced the arrest of a former opposition figure in similarly mysterious circumstances in October last year. It said Ruhollah Zam was arrested in a “sophisticated and professional operation”. Zam, described by Iran’s Revolutionary Guards as a “counter-revolutionary” who was “directed by France’s intelligence service”, was sentenced to death in June over “corruption on earth”. Zam, who reportedly lived in exile in Paris, ran a channel on the Telegram messaging application called Amadnews and was accused of sparking unrest during anti-government protests in 2017-18. The Islamic republic also captured the head of a Sunni Muslim rebel group in a dramatic operation in 2010 and executed him in the same year, boasting of its reach in capturing adversarial figures. Abdolmalek Rigi was arrested while on a flight from Dubai to Kyrgyzstan, when Iranian warplanes forced the plane he was travelling on to land in Iran. The rebel group Jundallah (Soldiers of God) had waged a deadly insurgency in Shiite Iran’s southeastern province of Sistan and Baluchistan for a decade before it was severely weakened by Rigi’s execution. \",\n  \"document_ocr\": \"\",\n  \"Category\": \"Insufficient_Text\"\n}, {\n  \"Id\": 34843,\n  \"claim_image\": \"http://pbs.twimg.com/media/D2edUsDWsAAgz6W.jpg?format=jpg&name=large\",\n  \"claim\": \"Republicans feel as vindicated as Democrats feel frustrated following Mueller's findings https://t.co/TqeOLgAgLc https://t.co/PweTdL4o8b\",\n  \"claim_ocr\": \"determined not to make a trad erning\\ner of indictments and convictions of individuals and\\nall of which have been publicly disclosed.

Russia reacts cautiously to Mueller report findingsMOSCOW -- The Kremlin has responded cautiously to the conclusion of special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation that found no evidence of a conspiracy by Donald Trump's presidential campaign to help Russia interfere in the 2016 U. S.  election. Russian President Vladimir Putin’s spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Monday he couldn't comment on Mueller's findings since no one had seen the report in full, and he denied again that Russia had meddled in 2016. \\\"We haven’t seen the report itself,\\\" Peskov said in a daily briefing call with reporters.  \\\"We have seen a certain condensed version, a summary, which, moreover, tells nothing new, except the acknowledgment of the absence of any conspiracy. \\\"Reiterating Russia's long-standing blanket denial that it had interfered in the 2016 election, Peskov said of Mueller's investigation, \\\"It's hard to find a black cat in a dark room, especially if it's not there. \\\"Attorney General William Barr on Sunday released a summary of the key findings of Mueller’s 22-month investigation into Russia's effort to influence the 2016 election.  In a letter to Congress, Barr quoted from Mueller's own report that the special counsel had found no evidence that Trump or anyone associated with his campaign had conspired with Russia, \\\"despite multiple offers from Russian-affiliated individuals to assist the Trump campaign. \\\"Peskov denied that Russia had sought to aid Trump or meddled in 2016 in any way.  He also rejected Mueller's finding that Moscow mounted a two-pronged influence operation targeting American social media and a hacking attack that stole and then leaked documents from the Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton's campaign. Other Russian officials' reactions were far more strident, however. Russia's foreign ministry criticized Mueller’s investigation in a Monday statement as a waste of time and resources, and said the accusation of Russian meddling was an \\\"obvious fake. \\\"\\\"The long-awaited Mueller report has proved what we in Russia knew from the very beginning: there was no conspiracy between Trump and someone from his team with the Kremlin,\\\" Kostantin Kosachev, a prominent senator who chairs Russia's senate committee on foreign affairs, wrote on his Facebook page, condemning what he said had been \\\"two years of ceaseless lies. \\\"Meanwhile, anchors on the main state news channel, Russia 24,  mocked how much time and space American media had given to what they called a \\\"fake. \\\"Mueller’s investigation saw 34 people charged, among them six Trump aides and advisers.  Twenty-five Russians, many of them military intelligence officers, were indicted for their role in the hack of Democratic party institutions, or for taking part in the social media campaign.  In those indictments, Mueller laid out how the Russia’s intelligence services and a so-called \\\"troll factory\\\" in Saint Petersburg had sought to influence the U. S.  electorate. Russian officials and state media for two years have insisted the accusations of election meddling are fantasies invented by the Democrats to be used as a pretext to sanction Moscow.  Despite Barr's letter stating the opposite, Russian officials on Monday portrayed Trump's clearing of collusion as also proving there had been no Russian interference of any kind. The Russian foreign ministry on Monday attacked the Obama administration, accusing it of trying \\\"to discredit Trump\\\" in 2016 by making \\\"unfounded accusations of 'hacking attacks. '\\\"The Obama administration in 2016 agonized over how to make Russia's election operations public, worrying over just such an accusation of partisan bias, former administration officials have since said.  After Republican leaders rejected a request to make a partisan statement calling out the Russian campaign, in the end, the Department of Homeland Security and the Office of the Director of National intelligence released a joint statement in October 2016 noting the Russian efforts, but leaving out whether the Russians had sought to help a particular candidate. With Mueller's investigation now over, some Russian senators said they hoped Trump might now try to improve relations with Russia, but they expressed doubts, saying they feared instead fresh sanctions were more likely to follow. \\\"We in Russia have little to celebrate,\\\" Kosachev wrote, saying he believed Congress would now argue that even without a conspiracy it was necessary to strengthen sanctions against Russia. \\\"There is a chance to reset much in our relations, but whether Trump will risk it remains an open question.  We, obviously, are ready,\\\" Kosachev wrote, adding Trump should use the moment to begin negotiations on two key arms agreements, the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces and the START treaties. Russia and the U. S.  in any case are at loggerheads in many areas unrelated to the 2016 election-- from Syria to Venezuela. Maria Lipman, a veteran Russian journalist and editor of the Counterpoint journal, agreed it was unlikely that Mueller's conclusion would ease the confrontation.  Having used Russia as \\\"a battering ram against Trump\\\" for the past two years, she said, it would be hard for Democrats to now put it aside and that the portrayal of one another in both countries was so negative that little could change in the short term. \\\"The antagonism between Russia and the U. S.  has become so deep that I don't think there can be any improvement.  I don't think we should expect any change,\\\" she said. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events\",\n  \"document_ocr\": \"HN'S CHL\\nC000\\nTasos Katopodis/Getty Images\\n\",\n  \"Category\": \"Insufficient_Text\"\n}, {\n  \"Id\": 34844,\n  \"claim_image\": \"http://pbs.twimg.com/media/E1mjW_LUYAA80-H.jpg?format=jpg&name=large\",\n  \"claim\": \"South Korea's daily #COVID19 cases stayed in 600s for 3rd consecutive day today, as infections from pvt gatherings, schools &amp; military bases continued.

Earlier, around 25,000 to 30,000 pilgrims would throng the cave shrine per day.  “From 5am to 6pm on Tuesday, 11,400 pilgrims had obtained yatra slips—4,400 offline and 7,000 online.  The figures are significantly low as compared to the pre-pandemic time,”an official said.  Last year, the shrine had been closed on March 18 and re-opened on August 16 after a hiatus of almost five months.  A health official said 71 travellers had tested positive in Katra on the first day of the festival.  “On Tuesday, we detected 85 new cases in Reasi, which included 71 travellers, 11 locals and two staff members.  So far, 498 people have tested positive in Reasi,” he said.  The travellers who tested positive were either sent back in specially designed cabs to Pathankot or kept in isolation.  “Largely, travellers who tested positive preferred to return home, for which the administration has kept seven to eight cabs.  For those, who choose to remain at Katra, the administration has the provision of paid quarantine in Katra and government quarantine at Panthal,” the official said.  Sources within shrine board said inviting devotional singers while the second wave of the pandemic is sweeping through the UT was irrational.  “Considering the surge in cases, the morning and evening aartis should have been left to the priests and singers of the shrine board,” they said.  At 5,200ft, the cave shrine is one of the holiest Hindu pilgrimages and devotees from all over the country and abroad visit the shrine on auspicious days.  The administration has fixed a ceiling of 25,000 pilgrims a day.  Pilgrims arriving in trains to Katra will undergo rapid antigen tests (RATs) at the Katra railway station where Covid kiosks have been set up.  Those arriving via road will undergo the test at Lakhanpur—the gateway to Jammu and Kashmir.  Local devotees will be tested at Banganga and flying in will be tested at the Jammu airport.  However, it is advisable for pilgrims coming from outside J&K to bring their Covid-19 negative reports, preferably RT-PCR test, not older than 72 hours.  The cave shrine was visited by 13,089 pilgrims on April 11.  Last year, in August, the figures had dipped to 7,253 and 27,427 in September before picking up momentum in October when 1,21,661 pilgrims visited the shrine followed by 1,03,749 devotees in November and 2,07,533 in December.  In January, 4,08,061 pilgrims had visited the shrine, 3,89,549 in February and in March the count was around 3. 5 lakh.  Meanwhile, shat chandi maha yagya commenced at the cave shrine on first day of the festival amid chanting of vedic mantras and performance of other religious ceremonies.  The maha yagya, which is being performed during navratras for peace, prosperity and health of humanity, will conclude with a purna ahuti on Ramanavami.  Board CEO Ramesh Kumar said elaborate arrangements have been made to facilitate the pilgrims who are expected to visit the holy cave shrine.  \",\n  \"document_ocr\": \"Ravneet Singh Bittu\\n1 hr O\\nAs it is being shown in the media, It is true that i have tested positive for corona.

According to the modified version of the scheme—Emergency Credit Line Guarantee Scheme (ECLGS 4. 0)—100% guarantee cover will be available to loans up to ₹2 crore to hospitals, nursing homes, clinics and medical colleges for setting up on-site oxygen generation plants with an interest rate cap at 7. 5%. “The ECLGS 4. 0 will further facilitate flow of institutional credit at reasonable terms to MSMEs,” a finance ministry spokesperson said. The ₹3 lakh crore ECLGS is one of the key components of the ₹20 lakh crore economic stimulus package launched in mid-May last year that offered additional working capital finance in the form of an easy term loan to small firms. The scheme also included the ailing civil aviation sector and further liberalised credit terms for existing beneficiaries. Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman’s office said in a tweet that the civil aviation sector would also be eligible to avail the easy credit under the scheme, and the validity of ECLGS was extended to September 30 or till guarantees for an amount of ₹3 lakh crore are issued.  Credit disbursements under the scheme are, however, permitted up to December 31, 2021. Earlier on March 31, the government had extended the scheme till June 30, but the industry wanted it to be extended till March 31, 2022, with an additional corpus of ₹3 lakh crore as the scheme was left with limited money. According to the banking industry, ECLGS has already exhausted ₹2. 54 lakh crore from the existing corpus of ₹3 lakh crore, and only about ₹46,000 crore is now available under the scheme.  The official quoted above said: “The government may enhance the corpus depending on its demand. ”The modified scheme—ECLGS 4. 0—has provided one-year additional tenure to borrowers who availed its credit facility last year under ECLGS 1. 0.  It has also relaxed various other conditions. “The modifications in ECLGS, would enhance the utility and impact of ECLGS by providing additional support to MSMEs, safeguarding livelihoods and helping in seamless resumption of business activity,” the finance ministry said in a statement. “The move aims at providing stimulus to the MSME sector, a worst sufferer of the second wave of Covid-19 pandemic.  More relief for MSMEs are expected after extensive consultations with stakeholders,” one official, aware of the development, said on condition of anonymity. Hindustan Times on May 21 wrote that the government was considering various support measures for MSMEs, including expanding the scope and tenure of ECLGS. \",\n  \"document_ocr\": \"\",\n  \"Category\": \"Insufficient_Text\"\n}, {\n  \"Id\": 34855,\n  \"claim_image\": \"http://pbs.twimg.com/media/EZ-dOIRWsAAakpE.jpg?format=jpg&name=large\",\n  \"claim\": \"Low-intensity earthquake of magnitude 2.1 hits Delhi: Report\\n\\nhttps://t.co/pgr5PASDhe https://t.co/hKsDC71Zbc\",\n  \"claim_ocr\": \"\",\n  \"document_image\": \"http://pbs.twimg.com/amplify_video_thumb/1293399460714881026/img/seLtNuR_lWPjmTTe.jpg?format=jpg&name=large\",\n  \"document\": \"A low-intensity earthquake of magnitude 2. 1 has hit Delhi, news agency PTI reported on Monday, quoting the National Centre for Seismology (NCS).

Since April, Delhi-NCR has recorded more than 14 quakes of low and medium intensity, PTI reported. Twin earthquakes within an hour shook Haryana late last month.  The tremors were felt in Delhi too. The first one, a 4-5 magnitude quake, was reported in Rohtak at 9 pm and the second one struck at 10 pm on May 29.  Both the earthquakes were shallow. A 2. 5 magnitude earthquake with its epicentre in Faridabad district was recorded by the National Centre for Seismology at 4. 24 pm a day before evening. There was another mild quake on May 15 of 2. 2 magnitude with its epicentre at 9 km from central Delhi. On May 10, people in Delhi and nearby areas felt tremors when a 3. 4 magnitude earthquake occurred with its epicentre in Sonia Vihar. Two earthquakes were also reported on two consecutive days in Delhi in April. Delhi falls under the fourth-highest zone in India, making it vulnerable to earthquakes.  But there haven’t been too many earthquakes which have its epicentre in the national capital.  Delhi mostly experiences tremors when a quake hits regions as far as central Asia or the Himalayan ranges, known to be a high-seismic zone. Seismologists, however, say that it is not unusual for the epicentre of these relatively small earthquakes to be in Delhi and neighbouring Haryana, seismologists said. They also say that a larger proportion of people have been feeling the earthquake because most people are at home and there is far less noise associated with traffic movement due to the ongoing Covid-19 lockdown. \",\n  \"document_ocr\": \"ANI\\n\",\n  \"Category\": \"Insufficient_Text\"\n}, {\n  \"Id\": 34856,\n  \"claim_image\": \"http://pbs.twimg.com/media/EA4JF7PXYAAKVA0.jpg?format=jpg&name=large\",\n  \"claim\": \"Ayodhya land case: The three member mediation panel has submitted its report in a sealed cover to the Supreme Court https://t.co/Ij62lI9Jgl\",\n  \"claim_ocr\": \"ANI\\nnews\\nflash\\n\",\n  \"document_image\": \"http://pbs.twimg.com/media/EA3d1HjU0AEWtGX.jpg?format=jpg&name=large\",\n  \"document\": \"Chief Justice of India Ranjan Gogoi, who had appeared unhappy yesterday that a letter requesting help sent by the Unnao rape survivor had not been placed before him, on Thursday signaled the top court’s determination to quickly take a call on the teenager’s SOS.

He assumes the responsibility at a crucial time, with the state witnessing the highest ever number of daily positive Covid19 cases and deaths due to the disease, with no immediate sign of the numbers decreasing. HT lists the top five challenges for the 52-year-old CM and his new cabinet. Covid crisisAs Sarma was the health minister in the previous Sonowal cabinet, and was hands-on in attempts at controlling spread of the disease, setting up Covid care centres, visiting patients at hospitals, procuring life-saving medicines and all required goods, it was expected he would keep the portfolio even after donning the CM’s chair. But he chose to give the responsibility to Keshab Mahanta, working president of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) alliance partner, Asom Gana Parishad.  The move surprised many as despite being a senior minister in the earlier cabinet, Mahanta doesn’t have much experience in handling such a crisis and his role as water resources minister in the previous cabinet wasn’t felt to be up to the mark. Assam is recording around 5,500-6000 new Covid-19 cases and an average of 70 deaths a day due to the disease.  With positivity rate hovering between 8% and 10%, the state has nearly 40,000 active cases — putting immense pressure on the state’s health infrastructure and all those involved in the medical sector. Also Read | Grenade blast in Assam’s Tinsukia leaves one dead, 2 injuredSarma is aware of the situation.  He has already instructed ministers to visit all districts and file a ground report on status of the pandemic within three days.  Stricter restrictions have been put in place, including closing down all office in urban areas and increasing the curfew duration to 15 hours daily.  On Wednesday, he directed officials to conduct around 100,000 tests daily to detect positive cases early. Fixing finances As finance minister in the Sonowal government, Sarma is well aware of the financial realities of the state.  As per government figures the state has liabilities of nearly ₹23,000 cr and total cumulative debt of around ₹85,000 cr.  Like other states, Assam too faced difficulties in achieving its projected growth estimates at least in the first two quarters of last financial year, but the state continued to pay full salaries and pensions to its serving and retired employees. Significantly, the CM didn’t keep this portfolio too with himself and gave the responsibility to Ajanta Neog, a former Congress minister and Sarma’s one-time cabinet colleague who switched sides to the BJP just ahead of the assembly polls and won from the Golaghat seat.  Incidentally, Neog is the state’s first woman finance minister. Addressing his first press conference on Monday after assuming charge, Sarma said that the state has ₹7,000 cr in its treasury and assured that the new government will be able to pursue its welfare and development schemes without facing any hurdles.  “We have one of the best fiscal situations in the country in the entire country.  There’s absolutely no cause of concern on Assam’s finances,” the CM claimed. Besides spending on Covid-19 control, the state government will also have to implement its ambitious promises of providing 100,000 jobs in the first year and waiving of nearly ₹12,000 cr of the microfinance loans taken by women self-help groups.  It will remain to be seen how Sarma and Neog are able to fulfill them and boost the state economy. NRC re-verification Among its ten commitments to voters of Assam ahead of the assembly polls, the BJP promised delivering a corrected National Register of Citizens (NRC) as per the Supreme Court (SC) mandate, in order to protect genuine citizens and detect illegal infiltrators so that Assam’s civilization “remains protected”. In Assam, as per the Assam Accord of 1985, anyone who has been staying in the state prior to March 24, 1971 or can establish lineage to people residing on or before that date is considered as Indian citizen — a requirement also accepted for inclusion in the National Register of Citizens (NRC) updated in 2019.  The names of around 1. 9 million people who failed to prove their or their ancestor’s residency in Assam on that date and those who were declared foreigners by foreigners’ tribunals (as well their relatives) were excluded from the NRC. Also Read | Bengal Guv Dhankhar to visit Assam to meet post-poll violence hit peopleThe BJP has maintained that the updated document is faulty as it has included dubious persons and excluded genuine citizens and needs to be re-verified.  The process has remained stuck as the NRC office is yet to issue rejection slips to those left out, allowing them to file fresh appeals for inclusion. “Our view on NRC is very clear.  We want 20% re-verification of the list in districts bordering Bangladesh and 10% re-verification in other districts.  If after that, the NRC is found to be correct, the state government would accept it and take the process forward.  But if the NRC is found faulty after re-verification, we would want the Supreme Court to view this issue critically,” Sarma said at his first press conference as CM. NRC coordinator Hitesh Dev Sarma has filed an application in SC, seeking a complete, comprehensive and time-bound re-verification of the draft NRC as well as the supplementary list of NRC as some “glaring anomalies of serious nature” were detected in the process.  The application sought re-verification to be done under supervision of a monitoring committee preferably represented by district judge, district magistrate and superintendent of police. ST status to six communities The BJP has also committed to granting scheduled tribe (ST) status to six communities of the state — Koch-Rajbongshi, Tai Ahom, Moran, Motok, Sutiya and tea-tribes, currently falling under other backward castes (OBC) category.  Prime Minister Narendra Modi had promised it ahead of 2014 Lok Sabha polls and it was also part of BJP poll promise in 2016 ahead of the Assam assembly polls. The promise hasn’t been fulfilled yet.  Though the Centre introduced a Bill in Rajya Sabha in January 2019 on granting ST status to these 6 communities, voting didn’t take place on it and the Bill lapsed.  The state’s first BJP-led government of Sarbananda Sonowal also didn’t take much initiative on the issue apart from creating autonomous councils form Morans, Motoks and Koch-Rajbongshis in September last year — ahead of this year’s assembly election. The six communities are estimated to have a total population of nearly 15 million.  While the BJP has been able to keep them pacified with the promise of ST status, by attracting some leaders of these communities to the party-fold and by creating the three new autonomous councils, it will have act fast if it doesn’t want this issue to lead to mass agitations. Also Watch | Assam: 18 elephants killed in lightning strikes in Nagaon district“Our government will try and ensure granting of ST status to these communities through talks with all stakeholders without hurting the interests of other communities who are already in the same category.  Our previous government had worked on some ways in which this issued could be resolved and we are confident on doing that in coming days,” Sarma said in his press conference. Flood-free Assam Floods are an annual scourge that affects millions in Assam every year.  The state witnesses several rounds of floods during the monsoon season, which leads to loss of lives, large scale erosion, thousands getting uprooted from their home and loss of property.  The biggest contributor to this flooding is the Brahmaputra that flows thorough Assam as well as its tributaries. In 2016, the BJP had promised to dredge the Brahmaputra river of excess silt and reduce the problem of flooding.  For this election, it listed Mission Brahmaputra with the aim of making the state flood-free on top of its 10 commitments made to voters. The BJP has promised new and scientific measures to control floods.  They include dredging, management of Brahmaputra’s tributaries, creating big reservoirs to accumulate extra water from the river, using satellite imagery to identify places where major flooding takes place, and drives to evict squatters from the banks of Brahmaputra and its tributaries. From public health to citizenship, from natural disasters to economy, Himanta Biswa Sarma will have to hit the ground running in Assam. \",\n  \"document_ocr\": \"\",\n  \"Category\": \"Insufficient_Text\"\n}, {\n  \"Id\": 34859,\n  \"claim_image\": \"http://pbs.twimg.com/media/EyHDofVVgAAWexe.jpg?format=jpg&name=large\",\n  \"claim\": \"Uttarakhand: Fire breaks out at Bairagi Camp in Kumbh Mela area in Haridwar, 10 fire tenders present at the spot. https://t.co/Hv8t1PBoFd\",\n  \"claim_ocr\": \"ANI\\n\",\n  \"document_image\": \"http://pbs.twimg.com/media/ErhZ4jXUcAIj9XP.jpg?format=jpg&name=large\",\n  \"document\": \"The caskets are stacked three high in the Meissen crematorium's somber memorial hall, piled up in empty offices and stored in hallways.  Many are sealed with plastic wrapping, others are labeled “infection risk,” “urgent” or simply “COVID. ”A surge of coronavirus deaths in this corner of eastern Germany has boosted business for crematorium manager Joerg Schaldach and his staff, but nobody is celebrating. “The situation is a little bit tense for us at the moment,” Schaldach said as another undertaker's van pulled up outside. The crematorium would typically have 70 to 100 caskets on site at this time of year, when the flu season takes its toll on the elderly. “It’s normal for more people to die in winter than in summer,\\\" said Schaldach.  \\\"That’s always been the case. ”Now he has 300 bodies waiting to be cremated and each day dozens more are delivered to the modernist building on a hill overlooking Meissen, an ancient town better known for its delicate porcelain and impressive Gothic castle. On Monday, Meissen county once again took the unwanted lead in Germany's Covid-19 tables, with an infection rate three times the national average.  The state of Saxony, where Meissen is located, includes six of the 10 worst-hit counties in Germany. Schaldach says the crematorium is doing its best to keep up with demand, firing up the twin furnaces every 45 minutes and managing 60 cremations a day. “The ashes still end up in the right urn,” he said. But whereas staff would normally try to ensure the deceased look good for relatives to bid their final farewells, infection rules now mean the caskets of Covid victims have to remain shut throughout, making the entire process even harder for those involved. “It’s our business, we’ve seen death many, many times,\\\" said Schaldach.  \\\"The problem we see is that the grieving relatives need our help.  And at the moment, there’s a greater need for words of consolation because they’ve given their deceased loved one to the ambulance and then they never see them again. ”Some have linked Saxony's high infection rate to wider anti-government sentiment in a state where over a quarter voted for the far-right Alternative for Germany party at the last national election.  Its lawmakers have objected to the need to wear masks, limits on people gathering and the closure of stores.  A few have even denied the existence of a pandemic outright. Other commentators have noted the state's large number of elderly and its reliance on nursing home workers from the neighboring Czech Republic, where Covid-19 infections are even higher. Officials in Meissen, including the head of the county administration, the local doctors association and the lawmaker representing the region in parliament, an ally of Chancellor Angela Merkel, all declined to be interviewed about the situation. Saxony’s governor, Michael Kretschmer, acknowledged in a recent interview with daily Freie Presse that he had underestimated the impact of the pandemic in his state and paid too much attention to those calling for businesses and schools to remain open. A video showing Kretschmer talking to anti-lockdown protesters outside his home Sunday ends with him walking away after one person dons a mask made to look like the German Imperial War Flag, a symbol favored by far-right extremists. Schaldach, the crematorium manager, says most people in Saxony accept the rules.  But he, too, has read comments on social media branding reports about bodies piling up at his crematorium as fake news. “Those who believe in conspiracy theories can’t be helped.  We don’t want to debate with them,\\\" he told The Associated Press.  \\\"They have their beliefs and we have our knowledge. ”Down in Meissen, the streets are empty, devoid of the usual tourists or even the bustle of locals. Franziska Schlieter runs a gourmet food store in the historic city center that's among the few allowed to stay open amid the lockdown.  Her store, which has been run by five generations of her family, is being sustained by a trickle of regulars buying lottery cards and gift baskets. “In the Bible, God sent people plagues when they didn’t behave,” said Schlieter, who feels easing the lockdown over Christmas was a mistake.  “Sometimes I have to think of that. ”On the cobblestone square, Matthias Huth tends a lone food truck outside his shuttered restaurant.  He defends those who have questioned the government’s Covid-19 restrictions, but says skepticism shouldn’t justify denial. “Conversations are starting to change,” Huth said as he served up a dish of chopped blood sausage, sauerkraut and mash known locally as ‘Dead Grandma. ’ “Everyone wants it to be over. ”\",\n  \"document_ocr\": \"\",\n  \"Category\": \"Insufficient_Text\"\n}, {\n  \"Id\": 34860,\n  \"claim_image\": \"http://pbs.twimg.com/media/ErhezLsUYAUJCux.jpg?format=jpg&name=large\",\n  \"claim\": \"I'd spoken to Goa CM after the accident, PM had spoken to him too.

He echoed Democratic leadership's calls for Mueller to testify before Congress. \\\"Let Mueller lay it out,\\\" Swalwell said.  \\\"Let's hear his voice describe the combat and see where that leaves Republicans and where that leaves the public. \\\"On the matter of obstruction of justice, Swalwell said it's also up to Congress to evaluate the president's actions detailed in the Mueller report and determine what action needs to be taken. \\\"If we do nothing, what does that mean for future presidencies? \\\" Swalwell asked.  \\\"What does that mean for the standard of conduct that we accept in our democracy? \\\"In the wake of the Mueller report's release, Swalwell also has made numerous calls for Attorney General William Barr to resign, accusing him of favoring Trump and misrepresenting the special counsel's findings by stating there was \\\"no evidence\\\" of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia.  In actuality, the report states that while the investigation \\\"identified numerous links between individuals with ties to the Russian government and individuals associated with the Trump campaign, the evidence was not sufficient to support criminal charges. \\\"\\\"I think,\\\" Swalwell added, \\\"he can either be the president's lawyer or America's lawyer. \\\"24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events\",\n  \"document_ocr\": \"ag%3D\\nmen.\\ntaged\\nYuri Gripas/Reuters\\nIT\\n\",\n  \"Category\": \"Insufficient_Text\"\n}, {\n  \"Id\": 34862,\n  \"claim_image\": \"http://pbs.twimg.com/media/EsKiWE-VQAArCW3.jpg?format=jpg&name=large\",\n  \"claim\": \"The tenth round of talks between farmer unions and the Centre over the three farm laws begins at Vigyan Bhawan in New Delhi. https://t.co/oqPjGpHgyu https://t.co/XrpvrwWxKy\",\n  \"claim_ocr\": \"ANI\\nTALLICA\\nveLU MAEc\\n\",\n  \"document_image\": \"http://pbs.twimg.com/media/EsKQ7bXUwAAStuB.jpg?format=jpg&name=large\",\n  \"document\": \"The government has to repeal the three farm laws, one of the farmers' unions asserted on Wednesday ahead of the 10th round of talks with the Centre.  \\\"The government has to make legislation on Minimum Support Price and repeal the three farm laws.

Leaders of all 40 farm unions which are taking part in the protest will meet three cabinet ministers of the government for talks this afternoon in an effort to end the impasse. In the last meeting, the Centre had suggested that the unions constitute their own informal group to prepare a concrete proposal on the three farm laws for further discussion at their next meeting.  Union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar also assured that the government will hear the proposal with an \\\"open mind\\\". Tens of thousands of farmers, mainly from Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh are agitating against three farm laws enacted by the government in September last year.  The central government has projected the laws as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove middlemen and allow farmers to sell anywhere in the country.  However, the protesting farmers have expressed apprehension that the new laws would pave the way for eliminating the safety cushion of Minimum Support Price and do away with the mandis, leaving them at the mercy of big corporates. The Centre has repeatedly asserted that these laws will remain and have offered to make amendments into the law. The contentious farm laws are farmers are the Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020, and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020. Meanwhile, the Supreme Court has stayed the implementation of the legislation till further orders.

What we learned from Michael Cohen's House Oversight Committee testimonyMichael Cohen, President Donald Trump's former lawyer and fixer, testifed publicly for the first time Wednesday about his experience in the Trump orbit before the House Oversight Committee, painting a harsh portrait of the president as an unscrupulous businessman who may have committed a crime while in office. Cohen also repeated what he said in a copy of his prepared remarks obtained by ABC News, claiming that Trump, as a candidate, knew his longtime confidant Roger Stone was talking with Julian Assange about WikiLeaks' possibly revealing emails hacked from the Democratic National Committee. In a statement to ABC News on Wednesday morning, Stone denied Cohen's allegation.  Julian Assange attorney Barry Pollack, in a statement, said, “Roger Stone did not have the telephone call Michael Cohen described. \\\"Here is how the hearing unfolded:5:20 p. m.  – Committee chairman in closing remarks: ‘We are better than this’In a fiery and impassioned speech to close out Wednesday’s blockbuster hearing after more than seven hours, Rep.  Elijah Cummings, D-Md. , called on members of his committee to “be better” as he sympathized with Cohen’s position. “We are better than this.  We are so much—we really are.  We are so much better than this,” Cummings said, adding, “when we are dancing with the angels, the question will be asked: in 2019 what did we do? ”Cummings’ sentiment drew an emotional response from Cohen, who appeared to be holding back tears when the chairman invoked the harm Cohen’s actions has caused his family. When he finished, Cummings pounded his gavel and adjourned the hearing more than seven hours after gaveling it in. 5:05 p. m.  – Cohen: If Trump loses 2020 election, 'I fear' there won’t be a peaceful transition of powerIn a dramatic statement at the conclusion of Wednesday’s hearing, Michael Cohen made a startling prediction: If President Trump fails to win a reelection bid in 2020, he may not give up his grip on power. “Given my experience working for President Trump, I fear that if he loses the election in 2020 that there will never be a peaceful transition of power,” Cohen said.  “This is why I agreed to appear before you today. ”Cohen then called on President Trump to cease attacks on the media, Gold Star families, and others. “You don't vilify people based on the god they pray to and you don't cuddle up to our adversaries at the expense of our allies,” Cohen said.  “You don't shut down to appease your base.  This behavior the office of the president and it simply is un-American. ”4:55 p. m.  – Democrat accuses GOP committee member of 'racist act'Rep.  Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich. , accused a Republican colleague of using a “black woman as a prop” during Wednesday’s testimony, sparking uproar from Republicans on the committee and calls for her comments to be stricken from the record. Tlaib’s statement came in response to Rep.  Mark Meadows, R-N. C. , inviting Lynne Patton, a current Department of Housing and Urban Development official and former longtime Trump Organization employee, to Wednesday’s hearing.  Meadows asked to include Patton’s statement defending Trump against accusations that he is “a racist” into the record.  Patton is a black woman. Meadows took issue with Tlaib’s remarks, offering an emotional rebuttal and defending his record of advocating civil rights for racial minorities. Tlaib clarified that she does not believe Meadows is a racist but accused him of “a racist act. ”4:45 p. m.  – Rep.  Ocasio-Cortez questions Cohen over Trump golf coursesIn a line of questioning by Rep.  Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N. Y. , Michael Cohen described how he said Donald Trump sought to garner tax deductions by reducing the value of his golf properties. Asked how the president did so, Cohen said, “you deflate the value of the asset and put in a request to the tax department for a deduction. ”Rep.  Ocasio-Cortez cited a lengthy New York Times article published in October describing “dubious tax schemes” Trump engaged in during the 1990s. 4:27 p. m.  – Hearing resumes after lengthy recessAfter a nearly two hour break -- an hour longer than stated -- members of the committee and Michael Cohen have returned to their seats for the final leg of questioning.  Overall, Cohen seems to have fended off most Republican attacks on him so far by taking a non-combative approach and repeatedly asserting that while he's lied previously, he's telling the truth now. 2:30 p. m.  – Stormy Daniels weighs in: ‘Michael, I’m proud of you’Shortly before the committee took what was expected to about an hour break for lunch, the adult film actress at the heart of president’s hush money payments controversy released a statement during Cohen’s testimony, saying she’s “proud” of Cohen for “finally beginning to tell the truth about what you did. ”Stormy Daniels, whose name has been repeatedly invoked over the course of Wednesday’s hearing for her role as the recipient of a hush money payment, appeared moved by Cohen’s testimony. “I can hear the pain and regret you feel for betraying your family and your country,” she said.  “Thank you for having the courage, at long last, to begin to tell the truth. ”Cohen executed the $130,000 payment to Daniels prior to the 2016 election.  President Trump has denied having an affair with Daniels. 2:10 p. m.  – Cohen describes plans to have Trump visit Russia during campaignMichael Cohen described negotiations he said he conducted with Trump campaign manager Cory Lewandowski “early on in the campaign” to have Trump visit Russia to “take a look” at the Trump Tower in Moscow project. Cohen and Lewandowski discussed the “possibility of which dates that Mr.  Trump would have availability if, in fact, that we were going to go over to Russia to take a look at the project. ”In November, Cohen pleaded guilty to lying to Congress about whether Trump and his company had pursued the Moscow real estate project while Trump was securing the GOP nomination in 2016. Cohen said the visit “never came to fruition because we were never successful in getting … ownership or control over a piece of property. ”1:45 p. m.  – Cohen contradicts Steele dossier, says he has never been to PragueMichael Cohen insisted under oath on Wednesday that he has never been to Prague or the Czech Republic, a central allegation in the dossier former MI-6 agent Christopher Steele compiled as opposition research. The dossier describes an incident in August 2016 in which Cohen allegedly traveled to Prague to meet with Russians.  Buzzfeed News posted the dossier in January 2017. Cohen has denied this claim in the past, including during an interview with ABC News. “I’ve never actually walked the land in Prague,” Cohen told ABC News.  “And last August I was not in Prague. ”1:25 p. m.  – Cohen says Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner’s attorney ‘reviewed’ his letter to Congress, tooAbbe Lowell, the attorney who represents the president's daughter and son-in-law, Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner, also reviewed Michael Cohen’s letter to Congress in 2017 that ultimately became the basis for charges Cohen lied to Congress, Cohen said Wednesday. They were not immediately available for comment. Cohen said earlier that Jay Sekulow, one of President Trump’s lawyers, made changes and additions to Cohen's statement, and mentioned that others may have, too. Late Wednesday afternoon, Sekulow issued a statement saying, “Today’s testimony by Michael Cohen that attorneys for the President edited or changed his statement to Congress to alter the duration of the Trump Tower Moscow negotiations is completely false. \\\"In his opening statement on Wednesday, Cohen said one of “Mr.  Trump’s personal lawyers reviewed and edited my statement to Congress about the timing of the Moscow Tower negotiations before I gave it. ”Cohen pleaded guilty in November to lying to Congress about whether Trump and his company had pursued the Moscow real estate project while Trump was securing the GOP nomination in 2016. 1:20 p. m.  – Cohen says Trump called him to coordinate messaging -- effectively lie -- about whether he knew about hush money paymentsMichael Cohen said during testimony on Wednesday that President Trump sought to coordinate public messaging about hush money payments to Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal in February 2018.  The women claim to have had affairs with Trump that he has denied. Trump instructed Cohen to say “he was not knowledgeable of the reimbursements and he wasn't knowledgeable of my actions,” Cohen said, referring to the hush money payments. Trump publicly denied knowledge of the payments before his attorney, Rudy Giuliani, confirmed later – in May 2018 – that Trump reimbursed Cohen for the $130,000 payment to Daniels. 1:00 p. m.  – Cohen says Trump lawyer Jay Sekulow made changes to his false statement to CongressMichael Cohen said one of President Trump’s lawyers, Jay Sekulow, made changes and additions to Cohen's statement to Congress in 2017 that ultimately became the basis for charges Cohen lied to Congress. In his opening statement on Wednesday, Cohen said one of “Mr.  Trump’s personal lawyers reviewed and edited my statement to Congress about the timing of the Moscow Tower negotiations before I gave it. ”He later identified that lawyer as Sekulow, who he said made “several changes … including how we were going to handle that message which was … the message, of course, being the length of time that the Trump Tower Moscow project stayed and remained alive. ”Sekulow has not addressed Cohen's claim. Cohen pleaded guilty in November to lying to Congress about whether Trump and his company had pursued the Moscow real estate project while Trump was securing the GOP nomination in 2016. 12:40 p. m.  – Cohen: Aware of another 'illegal act' Trump has committed, says SDNY investigatingMichael Cohen teased another “wrongdoing or illegal act” he claimed President Trump has committed, but said he could not give details because of an ongoing investigation headed by federal prosecutors in the Southern District of New York. Asked by Rep.  Raja Krishnamoorthi, D-Ill. , whether there is “any other wrongdoing or illegal act that you are aware of regarding Donald Trump that we haven't yet discussed today,” Cohen replied he was aware. “Yes,” he said, “and again, those are part of the investigation that's currently being looked at by the Southern District of New York. ”Cohen added that he is in “constant contact with the Southern District of New York regarding ongoing investigations. ”Outside the hearing room, SDNY had no comment. 12:30 p. m.  – Cohen to GOP: ‘Not one question so far has been about Mr.  Trump’In response to questions from Rep.  Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, Cohen called out Republicans on the panel for asking only about him and not President Trump. “I just find it interesting, sir, that between yourself and your colleagues, not one question so far since I'm here has been asked about President Trump,” Cohen said.  “That's actually why I thought I was coming today – not to confess the mistakes that I've made.  I've already done that. “The American people don't care about my taxes,” Cohen said.  “They want to know what it is that I know about Mr.  Trump, and not one question so far has been asked about Mr.  Trump. \\\"12:10 p. m.  – Cohen describes 'several factors' that led him to turn on TrumpAsked what caused him to turn on his longtime boss and effectively testify against him, Michael Cohen dramatically ticked off a list of Trump's actions and statements that led him to speak out. “Helsinki, Charlottesville, watching the daily destruction of our civility to one another, putting up with silly things like this,” Cohen said.  “It’s really unbecoming of Congress. ”Cohen said he used to protect Trump the way Republican members of the House Oversight Committee are protecting the president at Wednesday’s hearing. “I'm responsible for your silliness because I did the same thing that you're doing now for ten years,” Cohen said.  “I protected Mr.  Trump for ten years … I can only warn people the more people that follow Mr.  Trump, as I did blindly, are going to suffer the same consequences that I'm suffering. ”12:02 p. m.  – Cohen rejects accusation he’s trying to get a reduction in sentenceMichael Cohen denied a claim that his appearance is part of an effort to earn a reduction in his prison sentence. Asked by Rep.  Paul Gosar, R-Ariz. , whether his testimony could result in a reduction in his three-year sentence, Cohen said “it’s a possibility,” but rejected the notion that it is his purpose for testifying publicly before the House Oversight Committee. “I'm not sure how my appearance here today is providing substantial information that the Southern District can use for the creation of a case,” Cohen said, before joking, “Now if there is something that this group can do for me, I would gladly welcome it. ”Cohen is scheduled to report to prison on May 6. 12:00 p. m.  – Cohen describes Trump’s involvement in Trump Tower Moscow projectShortly before Michael Cohen asked for a break, he described what he said was the extent of Trump’s involvement in the Trump Tower Moscow negotiations during the campaign. “After each communication that I had [about the Trump Tower Moscow project], I would report back to [Trump] and our goal was to get this project,” Cohen said.  “We were interested in building what would have been the largest building in all of Europe. ”In his opening statement, Cohen said Trump remained directly involved in negotiations and often asked Cohen, “How’s it going in Russia? ”In November, Cohen pleaded guilty to lying to Congress about whether Trump and his company had pursued a Moscow real estate project while he was securing the GOP nomination in 2016. 11:45 a. m.  – Cohen pressed on his claim Trump is 'a racist'Rep.  Mark Meadows, R-N. C. , invited a guest to appear during his questioning of Cohen. Lynne Patton, a current Department of Housing and Urban Development official and former longtime Trump Organization employee, stood behind Meadows as he questioned Cohen about his allegation that Trump is “a racist. ”Meadows put a statement from Patton defending Trump into the record and asked Cohen to reconcile his claim with her defense of Trump as an African-American woman and the daughter of a man who grew up in Birmingham, Alabama. Cohen shot back by pointing out that he stands by his testimony as the son of a Holocaust survivor, prompting audible \\\"oohs\\\" from onlookers inside the hearing room. 11:30 a. m.  – Cohen hits back: 'Shame on you, Mr.  Jordan'Cohen, who once called himself Donald Trump’s “attack dog,” unleashed a heated rebuke of the ranking Republican on the committee, Rep.  Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, during a debate over whether Cohen accepted his guilt. Jordan read a quote the December indictment of Cohen written by federal prosecutors in the Southern District of New York.  It said Cohen’s “consciousness of wrongdoing is fleeting, his instinct to blame others is strong,” and accused Cohen of failing to appropriately show remorse for his actions. Cohen took issue with that characterization. “Shame on you, Mr.  Jordan,” Cohen said.  “That's not what I said.  What I said is, I took responsibility and I take responsibility … I am remorseful and I am going to prison. \\\"Cohen is scheduled to report to prison on May 6 to serve a three-year sentence. 11:12 a. m.  – Cohen says Trump and his children were ‘compromised’ by RussiaDuring a line of questioning about WikiLeaks’ release of internal Democrat National Committee and Hillary Clinton campaign emails, Cohen said he believes President Trump and his children may have been “conflicted or compromised” by Russia during the 2016 presidential campaign. He stopped short of characterizing the campaign’s alleged knowledge of the impending release of hacked Democrats’ emails as “collusion,” but said there was “something odd. ”\\\"As I stated in my testimony, I wouldn't use the word colluding,\\\" Cohen said.  Was there something odd about the back and forth praise with President Putin?  Yes.  But I'm not really sure that I can answer that question in terms of collusion. \\\"In his opening statement, Cohen claimed that Trump, as a candidate, knew his longtime political confidant Roger Stone was talking with Julian Assange about WikiLeaks' revealing of emails from prominent Democrats. 11:05 a. m.  – Cohen denies any desire to work in the White HouseRep.  Jim Jordan of Ohio, the ranking Republican on the committee and first to question Cohen, accused Cohen of acting in defiance of President Trump because he was upset at not getting a position in the White House after Trump’s election. Cohen categorically denied the allegation. “Mr.  Jordan, all I wanted was what I got, to be personal attorney to the president,” Cohen said. Cohen described an incident in which Trump \\\"reamed out\\\" former White House chief of staff Reince Priebus because Cohen hadn't gotten a job in the White House Counsel's office. 10:55 a. m.  – Questioning begins with an inquiry into hush money paymentsAfter Cohen’s 30-minute opening statement, the questioning portion of Wednesday’s hearing is underway. Rep.  Cummings, as committee chairman, began with a line of questioning about the hush money payments Cohen made to adult film actress Stormy Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, and his reimbursement by Trump. “The president said he knew nothing of these favors,” Cummings said.  “Based on your conversations with him, is there any doubt in your mind that President Trump knew exactly what he was paying for? ”“There is no doubt in my mind and I truly believe there is no doubt in the people of the United States of America,” Cohen said. Cohen presented a copy of a check Trump allegedly wrote, after taking office, to reimburse Cohen for the hush-money payment. Outside the hearing room, the Trump Organization responded that Donald Trump Jr.  had \\\"no concept/idea\\\" that he was signing a check to reimburse Cohen for the Stormy Daniels hush money payment.  Donald Trump Jr.  signed the $35,000 check as a trustee of the Donald J.  Trump Revocable Trust. President Trump has denied having an affair with Daniels. 10:42 a. m.  – Michael Cohen shares regrets, shame for a decade of work for Trump“And yet I continued working for him. ”That’s the refrain Michael Cohen is repeating after each damning anecdote he offers about President Trump.  Cohen’s opening statement included repeated mentions of how \\\"ashamed\\\" he feels now about his work for Trump. “I am ashamed because I know what Mr.  Trump is,” Cohen said. Cohen described with remorse the threatening letters he wrote on Trump’s behalf and the bidding he did for a man he called “a racist,” “a conman,” and “a cheat. ”“I am not a perfect man,” Cohen said.  “I have done things I am not proud of, and I will live with the consequences of my actions for the rest of my life. ”10:30 a. m.  – Cohen paints damning picture of Trump in opening statementMichael Cohen tore into President Trump’s character and business acumen in a scathing opening statement, calling him \\\"a racist,\\\" \\\"a con man\\\" and \\\"a cheat. \\\"ABC News reported details of Cohen’s intended testimony earlier on Wednesday. Cohen divulged that Trump, as a candidate, knew Roger Stone was talking with Julian Assange about WikiLeaks' revealing of emails from the Democratic National Committee. 10:25 a. m.  – Cohen sworn in, gives opening statementMichael Cohen began his opening statement after rising, raising his right hand, and being sworn in. \\\"Chairman Cummings, Ranking Member Jordan, and Members of the Committee, thank you for inviting me here today,” Cohen said.  “I am here under oath to correct the record, to answer the Committee’s questions truthfully, and to offer the American people what I know about President Trump. ”10:18 a. m.  – Ranking Republican slams Cohen, Democrats in opening statementThe ranking Republican on the Oversight Committee launched an early attack on Michael Cohen’s credibility and Democrats’ willingness to hear the former fixer’s testimony on Wednesday. “The first announced witness for the 116th Congress is a guy who is going to prison in two months for lying to Congress,” Rep.  Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, said in his opening comments. Jordan criticized Cummings for offering “a convicted felon a forum to tell stories and lie about the president of the United States so they can all start their impeachment process. ”“They just want to use you, Mr.  Cohen,” Jordan said.  “You're their patsy today. ”10:12 a. m.  – Chairman Rep.  Cummings warns Cohen not to lieIn his opening statement, the committee’s chairman, Rep.  Elijah Cummings, warned Cohen against lying to his panel. “I have made it abundantly clear to Mr.  Cohen that if he comes here today and he does not tell us the truth, I will be the first one to refer those untruthful statements to DOJ (the Department of Justice),” Cummings said. Cohen pleaded guilty to lying to Congress in December – charges brought by special counsel Robert Mueller. Cummings added that its hearing today and moving forward reflect a new era of Democratic oversight. “The days of this committee protecting the president at all costs are over,” he said. 10:07 a. m.  – Republicans move to postpone Cohen’s hearingA top Republican leveled an early effort to stop Cohen’s testimony, demanding the hearing be delayed. Rep.  Mark Meadows, R-N. C. , raised a procedural tactic to delay the hearing, citing the short notice of the committee’s receipt of Cohen’s testimony and evidence he plans to present. The committee voted down Rep.  Meadows’ point of order and the hearing continued. 10 a. m.  Cohen takes witness chair, hearing beginsMichael Cohen entered the committee at 10 a. m on the dot and took the witness chair for what promised to be dramatic testimony about his former boss Donald Trump before the House Oversight Committee.  The panel's chairman, Rep.  Elijah Cummings, D-Md. , gaveled in the hearing shortly thereafter. The man who once said he would take a bullet for Donald Trump is poised to excoriate his longtime former boss with more than a decade of anecdotes. In his opening statement, Cohen is expected to characterize Trump as a “racist” and a “conman. ”9:55 a. m.  Committee members gathering inside hearing roomMembers of the House Oversight Committee are gathering in the committee’s hearing room with just minutes until Michael Cohen is expected to take his seat. Democrats met this morning in committee chambers before congregating in the hearing room.  Republicans on the panel have set up large posters with Cohen’s past comments flattering the president. Cohen had no comment as he arrived on Capitol Hill.  As he left his hotel Wednesday morning, staff and hotel guests greeted and wished him well, some hugging him and people saying “God bless you. ”“I’m going to do the right thing,” Cohen said.  He also called it “the craziest day” of his life. Cohen, who spent a decade at Trump's side at the Trump Organization, will testify before House lawmakers at 10 a. m.  Wednesday as President Trump wraps up his first day of meetings with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Vietnam. Cohen is scheduled to begin a three-year prison sentence in May and has pleaded guilty to lying to Congress as well as financial crimes including bank and tax fraud.  Cohen also pleaded guilty to campaign finance violation for payments made to adult film star Stormy Daniels during the 2016 presidential campaign. The White House, along with Republicans on Capitol Hill, sought to discredit Cohen ahead of his appearance. \\\"Disgraced felon Michael Cohen is going to prison for lying to Congress and making other false statements,\\\" White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said Tuesday in a statement.  \\\"Sadly, he will go before Congress this week and we can expect more of the same.  It's laughable that anyone would take a convicted liar like Cohen at his word, and pathetic to see him given yet another opportunity to spread his lies. \\\"Rep.  Matt Gaetz, R-Fla. , a staunch Trump ally, also tweeted Tuesday that the hearing could reveal alleged details about Cohen's romantic life, prompting outrage from Democrats and ethics experts. The stakes were also high for Democrats in the House, who have vowed to investigate the president and conduct oversight of the administration amid accusations of overreach from Republicans. House Oversight Committee Chairman Elijah Cummings, D-Md. , suggested the hearing \\\"may very well be a turning point in our country's history. \\\"\\\"He's the only person that I know of who has accused this president of a crime,\\\" he told reporters on Monday. Cohen was prepared to provide lawmakers with documents to support his claims that Trump allegedly inflated and deflated his net worth for personal and professional gain, and to avoid paying property taxes, according to a source familiar with his intended testimony. The president's former fixer was also expected to explain why he lied to Congress in 2017 about discussions he had during the presidential campaign about the proposed Trump Tower Moscow. His specific allegation of criminal wrongdoing relates to Trump's reimbursement to Cohen for the payment to adult film actress and director Stormy Daniels, who alleged an affair with Trump, according to the source familiar with Cohen's planned testimony. Trump has denied the affair alleged by Daniels and another accusation from former Playboy model Karen McDougal and has previously said the payment amounted to nothing more than a \\\"simple private transaction,\\\" and that they do not qualify as campaign finance violations. Cohen appeared before the House Oversight and Reform Committee after postponing an initial hearing date, citing \\\"threats\\\" to his family by Trump and his lawyer Rudy Giuliani. On Tuesday he spent hours behind closed doors with the Senate Intelligence Committee and will meet with the House Intelligence Committee in private on Thursday. \\\"Two years ago when this investigation started, I said it may be the most important thing I'm involved in my public life in the Senate,\\\" Sen.  Mark Warner, D-Va. , the top Democrat on the panel, told reporters after the panel questioned Cohen.  \\\"Nothing I have heard today dissuades me from that view. \\\"\\\"We will call out the Democrats' charade for what it is -- a partisan circus meant to destroy President Trump,\\\" Reps.  Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, and Mark Meadows, R-N. C. , said in a USA Today editorial. At Cohen's sentencing hearing in December, special counsel Robert Mueller's team said Cohen had cooperated with their investigation. Ahead of the House hearing, during his day with the Senate Intelligence Committee, Cohen was officially disbarred as a lawyer in New York, according to a decision from the Appellate Division of the New York State Supreme Court expected after his November guilty plea.

Tough chance, but a chance indeed400 for IndiaRishabh Pant goes for a big one and the ball drops just ahead of Pat Cummins in long-on.

India 400/5More records for PujaraCheteshwar Pujara has batted 1200-plus deliveries thus far in the four matches, the most for an Indian batsman against Australia in a Test series, ahead of Dravid’s 1203 balls faced in 2003-04.

The Pujara ShowIn Tests since 2000, only three players have scored more runs than Cheteshwar Pujara, at a higher average, and with a higher dismissal rate: Jacques Kallis, Rahul Dravid, and Shivnarine Chanderpaul.  #AUSvINDPant on songRishabh Pant has started the innings on a positive note with few good shots and he is probably the best partner Pujara could have asked for right now.  Pant’s shot play has taken the pressure away from the more experienced batsman and he can concentrate on playing his natural game.  India 363/5No Reviews LeftAustralia have used up their second review as Tim Paine was convinced that Rishabh Pant has nicked one back to his gloves.  However, the DRS did not show any sign of an edge and Australia have no reviews left.

It was a faint edge off the bat and Labuschagne made no mistake in completing the catch.  India 329/5Pujara 150Cheteshwar Pujara drives Nathan Lyon for a boundary and that also brings up his 150.  It has been an impressive show from the batsman and he became the fifth Indian batsman ever to score a 150+ in Sydney.  India 328/4Double Bowling ChangeNathan Lyon and Mitchell Starc are introduced into the attack one after the other.  Josh Hazlewood and Pat Cummins were not much effective in the first 45 minutes and the onus will now be on these two to provide the crucial breakthrough for Australia.

India 314/4Pujara The WallNew day.  Same Pujara.  The India batsman has been quite consistent with his defensive play and he has started Day 2 in the same manner.  With Pat Cummins and Josh Hazlewood bowling good length deliveries, Pujara is looking quite comfortable out in the middle.  India 308/4Pitch ReportWent to take a look at the pitch.  Little rough developing outside the left hander's off stump at the pavilion end.  Not worrisome yet but if India keep Australia's bowlers in the field longer, Jadeja will begin to get very interestedStart of playCheteshwar Pujara and Hanuma Vihari are out in the middle for India while Josh Hazlewood will be bowling the first over of the day for Australia.  India are well placed in this game and they will be looking to post a big total. Agarwal on PujaraPujara was unbeaten on 130 runs at stumps, having faced 250 balls, the fourth time he has played 200-plus deliveries in an innings on this tour.  Agarwal talked about learning from his batting style and showered heady praise on the senior batsman who scored his third hundred of the series on Thursday. “Definitely, it is great to watch him bat from the other end and also to watch him bat the way he grinds the bowlers.  He has got a pattern to it and he understands his strengths and know that he is very tight with his defence.  He looks to do that and waits for the bad ball to come. “This game is for five days and there is time.  It is a very long game and if you see him bat, you can learn a lot.  Patience is his strength and he sticks to that,” he said. Phenomenal PujaraMost runs on Day 1 of a Test by an Indian in Australia:195 V Sehwag, MCG, 2003144 M Vijay, Gabba, 2014132 S Gavaskar, SCG, 1986130 C Pujara, SCG, 2019 *124 S Tendulkar, Adelaide, 2008123 C Pujara, Adelaide, 2018India’s RecordIndia have never lost a test match when Kohli has won the toss -- winning 18 and drawing three -- but more importantly the tourists had the opportunity to bat the Australians out of the game as they did in Melbourne. Australia BowlersFor Australia, Hazelwood emerged as the highest wickets taker on the day with two wickets in his kitty while Starc and Lyon contributed with one wicket each on Day One of the match. Agarwal Disappointed“I am quite disappointed for missing out on a big score.  With that said, it’s a learning curve.  If I don’t make this mistake again, it will be a good learning.  I was looking to dominate Nathan Lyon and it didn’t work out.  Really disappointed that I threw my wicket,” Mayank Agarwal said on Thursday. India eye historyThe visitors lead the series 2-1 after winning the opening clash in Adelaide and the third one in Melbourne.  Australia claimed victory in Perth.  If India, the world’s top-ranked nation, win or draw in Sydney they will clinch a first-ever series in Australia since they began touring Down Under in 1947-48. Kohli booed in SydneyFormer Australian captain Ricky Ponting has slammed sections of the SCG crowd for booing India skipper Virat Kohli when he walked out to bat on the opening day of the fourth Test here Thursday.  Kohli was given a mixed reception when he came to bat after the fall of opener Mayank Agarwal with the Indians fans chanting his name, while some of Australia’s fans booing the star batsman.  “If it was booing then it’s absolutely disgraceful,” Ponting said on Channel 7. Pujara reigns supremeAt stumps, Pujara (130) and Hanuma Vihari (39) were holding fort for the visiting side, which is in pursuit of a maiden Test series triumph on Australian soil.  Virat Kohli’s men have already secured the Border-Gavaskar Trophy with their unassailable lead. Hello and welcomeWelcome to the live coverage of Day 2 of the fourth Test match between India and Australia.  Day 1 belonged completely to India as Cheteshwar Pujara contributed an unbeaten 130 to India’s 303 for four.  The hosts, facing a desperate scrap to avoid being the first Australia team to lose a series to India on home soil, managed to dislodge Mayank Agarwal after a bright 77, Virat Kohli for 23 and Ajinkya Rahane for 18.  But Pujara took his series tally to 458 and add another century to those that helped India to wins in Adelaide and Melbourne. \",\n  \"document_ocr\": \"Super Dom\\n\",\n  \"Category\": \"Insufficient_Text\"\n}, {\n  \"Id\": 34866,\n  \"claim_image\": \"http://pbs.twimg.com/amplify_video_thumb/1398016978175074311/img/2f6PEw7-LU86dd5Q.jpg?format=jpg&name=large\",\n  \"claim\": \"\\\"He somehow knew I was there.\\\"\\n\\n“Alex was really fighting hard.

Three newly-elected BJP lawmakers from north Bengal, Sankhar Ghosh from Siliguri, Sikha Chatterjee from Dabgram-Fulbari and Anandamoy Burman from Matigara-Naxalbari, were detained by the police when they started a sit-in demonstration at Hafdar Hashmi Chowk in Siliguri demanding better handling of healthcare facilities in the wake of a sharp spike in Coronavirus infections in the region.  “The three legislators were detained because there is a ban on political assembly.

Former Trinamool Congress (TMC) minister Gautam Deb, who has been made administrator of the Siliguri Municipal Corporation following his defeat at Dabgram-Fulbari, said, “The BJP MLAs acted irresponsibly only to be in the news. ” Police detained several people in other parts of Bengal for violating lockdown restrictions.  Some people were arrested as well.  Although there is a ban on all modes of transport, including local trains, buses and Kolkata Metro, many people were caught driving personal vehicles.  Some grocery stores were shut down by the authorities in Kolkata, East Burdwan, East Midnapore, North 24 Parganas (a district with high infection rate), Purulia and Hooghly districts as the owners were found to be operating beyond the stipulated time of 7 to 10 am.  Two employees of a gymnasium at Srirampore in Hooghly district were detained for letting a few members enter through the back door.  The Bengal government on Saturday said sweetmeat shops can operate from 10 am to 5 pm.  Owners of four shops that opened before time were arrested at Dantan in East Midnapore.  At Park Circus in Kolkata, a milk van was detained for carrying some migrant labourers.  The passengers told the police that they were trying to reach Howrah station to catch a Bihar-bound train.  Flights and inter-state trains have been exempted from the lockdown.  \",\n  \"document_ocr\": \"\",\n  \"Category\": \"Insufficient_Text\"\n}, {\n  \"Id\": 34870,\n  \"claim_image\": \"http://pbs.twimg.com/media/EwrrJO6U8AE0hJi.jpg?format=jpg&name=large\",\n  \"claim\": \"West Bengal polls: BJP’s tryst with a party-society\\n\\nhttps://t.co/h69jA4CHe3\\n\\n#WestBengalElections https://t.co/kFXODZJGLO\",\n  \"claim_ocr\": \"नিজেপি\\nবিজেপি\\n\",\n  \"document_image\": \"http://pbs.twimg.com/media/EtO3x8sXEAcaqpX.jpg?format=jpg&name=large\",\n  \"document\": \"The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) seems to be facing an interesting predicament in selecting candidates in the West Bengal elections.  Of the 122 candidates it has declared so far, four are sitting members of Parliament, though Swapan Dasgupta has resigned from his Rajya Sabha membership after his candidature was found to be in violation of norms for nominated members in the Upper house.  The party has also not declared any chief ministerial candidate in the elections, even though Mamata Banerjee’s personal popularity is supposed to be the Trinamool Congress’s (TMC) biggest trump card in these elections.  Many commentators have pointed out that it suggests a dearth of candidates in the BJP. That doesn’t fit with reports of large-scale protests at the BJP’s office in Kolkata and elsewhere by party workers who are dissatisfied with the candidate selection.  This underlines an intense inner-party competition for securing nominations in the forthcoming polls. So what explains this seeming contradiction? This is best understood by deploying the concept of “party-society”, an idea developed by Dwaipayan Bhattacharyya, among the most eminent social scientists to have worked on the state’s politics, and currently a professor of political science at Jawaharlal Nehru University. Also Read | In West Bengal, battle for Matua vote heats upA brief recap of the BJP’s rise in West Bengal and the existing state of play in the state’s politics is useful before getting into Bhattacharyya’s idea and its relevance to the question at hand. Usurping the CPI(M) vote bank will not be enough for the BJPThe BJP first made its impact in the state in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, when its vote share jumped to 17% and it won two Lok Sabha seats.  The BJP’s rise came at the cost of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) or CPI(M) led Left Front, which suffered an almost equal erosion in its vote share.  This trend gained further momentum in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, when the TMC suffered a huge fall in seat share—its tally went down from 34 to 22 between 2014 and 2019—despite the party increasing its vote share by around three percentage points.  The CPI(M) led Left Front suffered a collapse of sorts in these elections with a vote share of less than 10%, the BJP again gaining most of it. While the BJP’s gains were impressive, even a repeat of the 2019 performance will not be enough to bring it to power in the state.  An assembly constituency (AC) wise disaggregation of 2019 results would give the TMC and BJP 164 and 121 seats respectively.  The halfway mark in West Bengal assembly is 148. Winning 18 Lok Sabha seats is one thing; forming a state government, entirely another.  Here’s why. West Bengal has the second largest share of Muslims—the 2011 census puts it at 27%—in any state in India, after Assam.  This basically means that the BJP must win around two-thirds of the non-Muslim voters to try and reach a 45% vote share in what has become an almost entirely bipolar contest to get past the halfway mark. Also Read | Barak Valley: Cong’s anti-CAA stance may hurt it; BJP’s worry is Assam AccordThis is a very different sort of a challenge compared to a state such as Assam, which has the largest share of Muslims—34% according to the 2011 census—in India.  The BJP formed a government in Assam with less than 30% of vote share, because it was in alliance with other regional parties.  There are no such allies for the BJP in West Bengal.  Having usurped most of the CPI(M)’s base—at least a significant part of what is left with the CPI(M) is its ideological cadre that would be ideologically averse to voting for a Hindutva driven party—the only logical option for the BJP is to target the TMC’s non-Muslim vote bank. TMC defections to the BJP: a bitter pill which must be swallowed The BJP realised this much before the 2021 elections.  While Mukul Roy, once considered Mamata Banerjee’s trusted lieutenant in the TMC switched sides in 2017 itself, Prime Minister Narendra Modi gave a hint of what was to come when he claimed during the 2019 campaign that at least 40 TMC MLAs were in touch with the BJP and would quit the TMC after declaration of results. Even in 2019, the BJP successfully fielded TMC turncoats such as Arjun Singh, a four-time TMC MLA, from Barrackpore.  After the BJP won 18 Lok Sabha seats in the 2019 polls, the floodgates seem to have opened as far as exodus of TMC leaders to the BJP is concerned.  The most prized post-2019 defector has been Suvendu Adhikari.  His defection has forced Mamata Banerjee to shift her assembly constituency and face Adhikari in Nandigram to preserve the aura of TMC’s invincibility in the strategically important South Bengal region. While these defections are important in bringing popular faces and politically necessary muscle to the BJP on the ground, they also cause some collateral damage.  An important reason for defection of CPI(M) supporters to the BJP was the former’s inability to take on the TMC cadre’s strong-arm tactics. Also Read | Full coverage of assembly elections 2021This was best seen in the 2018 Panchayat polls in the state, which saw the highest share of seats being decided without any contests (in favour of the ruling party).  This basically means opponents were not even allowed to file nominations.  While this is not a unique thing in West Bengal politics, the scale was unprecedented.  This figure was 34% for gram panchayats in 2018, more than three times the previous record of 11% under the CPI(M) in 2003.  In some districts, the share of uncontested seats was at least 50%.  A 2018 HT article by political scientist Neelanjan Sircar discussed this issue in detail.  With some of the TMC leaders who helped achieve this now joining the BJP, those who were already part of the latter, or moved to it from the CPI(M) are not just likely to feel disappointed but also upset at their one-time oppressors joining the same camp. Anecdotal accounts confirm that giving tickets to TMC turncoats is a major factor behind BJP workers protesting against the party’s ticket distribution. But winning West Bengal is crucial for preserving the BJP’s dominant party imageWhy is the BJP doing what it is doing?  West Bengal is perhaps the most important state election the BJP will face before the 2024 Lok Sabha elections.  In some ways, the political importance of 2021 West Bengal contest can be compared to the 2017 Uttar Pradesh contest, where the BJP’s victory gave it a huge boost. The BJP, under its current leadership, is not averse to taking positions which contradict its larger politics in order to win elections or secure power.  The party’s failed coalition with the People’s Democratic Party in the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir is one example.  The BJP wants complete electoral dominance and it wants it now.  It is this urgent hunger for power which has necessitated the BJP’s engagement with West Bengal’s “party-society”. party-society: West Bengal’s contribution to the political science lexicon The CPI(M)-led Left Front ruled West Bengal for an uninterrupted 34 years from 1977 to 2011.  This is a record in democratic politics not just in India but across the world.  What explains the CPI(M)’s ability to win elections for so long? As is to be expected, opinions are polarised on this issue.  While the CPI(M) and its sympathisers claim that it was the Left’s pro-poor policies, especially land reforms, which ensured its victories, its opponents allege large-scale intimidation and electoral malpractices behind the dominance.  None of these maximalist positions can tell us the truth.  If the CPI(M) had a solid support from the peasantry, why did it risk land acquisition which ultimately cost it its biggest support base in the country?  And if it was indeed rigging which earned the CPI(M) its victories, why could it not win the 2008 Panchayat and 2009 Lok Saha elections, even though it was ruling the state? Among the most cogent explanations of this issue has been given by Dwaipayan Bhattacharyya, who has evolved the concept of something called a party-society in response to the concept of Political Society, which was developed by Partha Chatterjee, a political scientist based at Columbia University and the Centre for Study of Social Sciences in Kolkata. A 2009 Economic and Political Weekly paper called Of Control and Factions: The Changing ‘Party-Society’ in Rural West Bengal by Bhattacharyya discusses these issues.  Chatterjee describes a Political Society as “made of poor and marginal population groups which, in absence of citizen’s rights, protect their livelihood demand along the lines of communities (not primordial but strategic solidarities in response to concrete governmental policies) as they negotiate with the state and civil society”.  A group of slum dwellers who have encroached upon government land and use politics to negotiate their interests is a good example of this.  Chatterjee attributed the CPI(M)’s success to its “day-to-day management of political society with the help of a well-orchestrated, locally embedded and vertically connected party-machinery”. Bhattacharya describes his idea of party-society as “a specific form of Political Society in West Bengal’s country-side” which he says was made possible by “popular acceptance of political parties as moral guardians not only in the public life of the society but also in the private lives of the families”.  To simplify academic jargon, in a party-society, one can expect a political party to intervene not just in issues in the society, say something like the construction of a school, but even in intra-family disputes such as marital discord or a property dispute among siblings. While this makes a party-society more pervasive than a political society, Bhattacharyya also underlines an important difference between the two.  In the former, “the over-riding goal is to protect the constituency of a party’s support-base and expand it periodically from election to election”, he says.  Because even Panchayat elections in West Bengal are held under party-affiliation, “party-society in rural West Bengal operating mainly through Panchayat elections runs the risk of being repetitive and predictable, if not explicitly bureaucratic”, he writes. The TMC did not dismantle the party-society CPI(M) built, it merely usurped it Bhattacharyya’s paper, which was written before the 2009 Lok Sabha elections, is a prescient account of the CPI(M)’s eventual fate.  In one of the villages where he did field work, the CPI(M)’s local leadership, which included its Panchayat functionaries had to adjudicate issues catering to various vested interests such as sale of land which was supposed to be under the possession of tenants, and where the pursuant wanted to build residential properties but the party, read the CPI(M), wanted a factory built.  The final decision by the party was not made on merits of the case but depended on factional balance of power within the higher party organisation. As is to be expected, such activities are bound to create a set of gainers and losers, and it is entirely likely that the latter would constitute the majority of voters.  It is this pent-up discontent against the CPI(M) cadre which was exploited by the TMC to perpetrate large scale violence against the left’s grassroots leadership in large parts of the state after 2011.  In many of these instances, the TMC leadership forced the opposition cadre to switch sides in return for “physical safety”, a tactic which was borrowed from the left’s playbook but magnified manifold. Once in power, the TMC found it useful to usurp the party-society model rather than dismantle it.  If anything, the TMC’s party-society is a cruder version of what existed during the CPI(M), because unlike the latter, there is no coherent ideological core to the TMC’s politics. The unprecedented level of intimidation in the 2018 Panchayat elections, which were held in the backdrop of a surprise BJP victory in CPI(M) ruled Tripura, which also has a significant Bengali population, was a clear attempt by the TMC to tighten the party-society’s hold in West Bengal’s rural political landscape. 2021 is the BJP’s tryst with party-society The BJP realises that unless the TMC’s hold over party-society is broken, it will be difficult to capture political power in the state.  It is this realisation which has forced it to woo TMC leaders and cadre to join the party. However, there are two reasons why the BJP’s attempts to usurp West Bengal’s party-society will be even more chaotic than the TMC’s. The CPI(M) controlled the party-society beast through a highly disciplined organisation, which worked on Stalinist lines and where questioning the party leadership meant expulsion.  What the TMC lacked in organisational discipline, it compensated for in Mamata Banerjee’s personal charisma, which is what has been driving the party’s electoral fortunes.  The BJP has neither at the moment.  While it has a committed cadre drawn from the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), this is not enough to catapult the party to power in the state.  The lack of a clear leader in the state also means that it is easier to rebel against the leadership’s decisions on questions such as ticket distribution without antagonising the central leadership.  The blame can be conveniently put on the state-level leadership.  Such disputes will only increase when it comes to elections for local bodies. Because the BJP’s political modus operandi involves not giving tickets to Muslims, who have a sizeable presence in the state, non-Muslims would have bigger expectations of getting a nomination in the BJP than any other party.  Think of a Muslim majority AC which would have not had any Hindu leader hopeful of securing a nomination.  The BJP does not have this luxury.  The BJP’s model of building a rainbow Hindu coalition in the name of Sabka Saath, Sabka Vishwas —(support of all, trust of all)—is also a recipe for Sabka Saath, Sabka Vivaad—(support of all, dispute among all. )This does not rule out the BJP’s chances in West Bengal None of what has been discussed should be inferred to conclude that the BJP does not stand a chance in West Bengal in the short-term or medium-term.  The BJP was just about three percentage points behind the TMC in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls.  West Bengal will be a closely contested election.  What can be said is that West Bengal is bound to undergo a deep political churning, which will last beyond the forthcoming elections. The BJP’s current dominance in Indian politics has triggered its own set of socio-political processes.  Political scientists Sudha Pai and Sajjan Kumar offer an insightful analysis of this process and described it as “Everyday Communalism” in their 2018 book published by the Oxford University Press called Everyday Communalism: Riots in Contemporary Uttar Pradesh.  The authors argue that the ability to convert even day to day disputes, some of them really petty, into communal conflicts is crucial the BJP’s political success in the state.  It will not be an understatement to say that the BJP is trying to deploy this tactic in the West Bengal contest as well, as was described by Kumar in an HT article explaining the salience of the BJP’s Jai Shri Ram push in West Bengal. The BJP clearly hopes to co-opt parts of what constitutes the TMC-dominated party-society today and eventually reshape West Bengal’s polity on the lines where political polarisation is driven by questions of Everyday Communalism.  Irrespective of what the results are on May 2, this ambition is bound to generate a lot of churn and disruption in West Bengal in not just the short but also medium-term. \",\n  \"document_ocr\": \"ANI\\n\",\n  \"Category\": \"Insufficient_Text\"\n}, {\n  \"Id\": 34871,\n  \"claim_image\": \"http://pbs.twimg.com/media/EAQZ7XIWkAArNwT.jpg?format=jpg&name=large\",\n  \"claim\": \"Live Now: Robert Mueller testifies in his second hearing today on Capitol Hill.\\n\\nWatch on CNN: https://t.co/UYpqI3w42L\\n\\nFollow rolling updates: https://t.co/B5ATNi0ODY https://t.co/DVU8H7hL0J\",\n  \"claim_ocr\": \"Capitol Hill\\n1:07 PM ET\\nUS House of\\nPERMANE\\nINT\\nMMITTEE ON\\nGENCE\\nER SPECIAL COU\\nROBERT S.

Mueller contradicts Trump, says report did not exonerate himFormer special counsel Robert Mueller answered questions for the first time for more than six hours on Wednesday during historic testimony on Capitol Hill in back-to-back House hearings into his probe into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and possible obstruction of justice by President Donald Trump. Key moments included Mueller saying his report did not exonerate the president as Trump has claimed and contending he could be charged after leaving office. But he also did not answer many questions, frustrating both Republicans, who tried to discredit his probe, and Democrats who pressed him on whether he had left it to Congress whether to pursue impeachment, believing that Justice Department policy prevented him from indicting a sitting president. Democrats on the House Judiciary and Intelligence committees labored for months to bring the 74-year-old Mueller before Congress to answer lingering questions about his 22-month investigation. Mueller was reluctant to appear before Congress, and only agreed to appear under subpoena from both panels.  \\\"The report is my testimony,\\\" he said in his only public statement on the report in May. Here is how the day developed:3:25 p. m.  'Had it been anyone else in the country they would have been indicted,' Chairman Schiff said as hearing endedAfter more than six hours of facing questions, Robert Mueller spent his last few minutes of his historic testimony listening to bluntly-worded final comments from Rep.  Adam Schiff,\\\"The facts you set out in your report and have spoken about today, tell a disturbing tale of a massive Russian interference in our election, of a campaign so eager to win, so driven by greed, it was willing to accept the help of a hostile power in a presidential election decided by a handful of votes in a few key states,\\\" Schiff said. \\\"They risked going to jail by lying to you, to the FBI and to congress about it and indeed some have gone to jail over such lies.  And your work speaks of a president who committed many acts of obstruction of justice.  Had it been anyone else in the country they would have been indicted,\\\" Schiff said. Schiff then excused Mueller and the former special counsel left the room quietly without making further comment. 3:14 p. m.  Mueller is asked about Trump's tax returns\\\"Your office did not obtain the president's tax returns which could otherwise show foreign financial services, correct? \\\" Rep.  Raja Krishnamoorthi, an Illinois Democrat, asked. \\\"I'm not going to speak to that,\\\" Mueller said. \\\"In July 2017, the president said his personal finances were off limits or outside the per view of your investigation.  And he drew a red line around his personal finances. Were the president's personal finances outside the purview of your investigation? \\\" Krishnamoorthi asked. \\\"I'm not going to get into that,\\\" Mueller responded. \\\"Were you instructed by anyone not to investigate the president's personal finances? \\\" Krishnamoorthi said. \\\"No,\\\" Mueller answered. 3:13 pm Mueller said Trump's written answers were 'generally' not truthful\\\"Director Mueller, is it fair to say the president's written answers were not only inadequate and incomplete, because he didn't answer many of your questions, but where he did, his answers showed he wasn't always being truthful? ,\\\" Rep.  Val Demings, D-Fla. , asked. \\\"I would say generally,\\\" Mueller said. 3:03 p. m.  Mueller questioned on why he didn't subpoena Trump A Democrat posed a question that many in his party have asked from early in Mueller's investigation. \\\"Why didn't you subpoena the president? \\\" Rep.  Sean Maloney, D-N. Y. , asked. \\\"At the outset, after we took over the investigation and began and pursued it, one of the things we anticipated wanting to accomplish is getting the -- having the interview of the president,\\\" Mueller said.  \\\"We negotiated with him for a little over a year, and I think what you alluded to in the appendix lays out our expectations as a result of those negotiations.  But when we were almost toward the end of our investigation, we had no success to get the interview of the president, we decided we did not want to exercise the subpoena power because of the necessity of ending the investigations,\\\" Mueller said. \\\"Excuse me? \\\" Maloney said. \\\"If we did subpoena the president, he would fight the subpoena, and we would be under the investigation for a substantial period of time,\\\" Mueller said2:47 p. m.  Mueller said Russians are actively trying to interfere in U. S.  elections\\\"In your investigation, did you think that this was a single attempt by the Russians to get involved in our election?  Or did you find evidence to suggest they'll try to do this again? \\\" Rep.  Will Hurd, R-Texas, asked. \\\"It wasn't a single attempt.  They're doing it as we sit here.  And they expect to do it during the next campaign,\\\" Mueller said. 2:30 pm Mueller refuses to answer questions about Donald Trump Jr. After the hearing resumed, Mueller was asked about another matter that critics have questioned: his handling of the president's son. \\\"Did you want to interview Donald Trump Jr. ? \\\" Rep.  Eric Swalwell, D-Calif. , asked. \\\"I'm not going to discuss that,\\\" Mueller said. \\\"Did you subpoena Donald Trump Jr. ? \\\" Swalwell asked. \\\"I'm not going to discuss that,\\\" Mueller answered. 2:15 p. m.  Chairman Schiff calls a recess for 5-10 minutes after Mueller questioned about Trump and WikiLeaksThe plan was that Mueller would testify for about two hours before the House Intelligence Committee but aides said it could go somewhat longer. A few minutes earlier Rep.  Mike Quigley, an Illinois Democrat, ran through a series of slides showing Trump quotes about WikiLeaks, prompting Mueller to call Trump's encouraging comments \\\"problematic. \\\"\\\"If we could put up slide 6: 'This just came out.  Wikileaks.  I love WikiLeaks. ' Donald Trump, October 10, 2016.  'This WikiLeaks stuff is unbelievable.  You have to read it. ' October 12, 2016.  'This WikiLeaks is like a treasure trove. ' Donald Trump October 31, 2016.  'Boy, I love reading those WikiLeaks. ' Would any of those quotes disturb you, Mr.  Director? \\\" Quigley asked. \\\"How do you react to those?  \\\" Quigely asked\\\"It's problematic is an understatement to say the least - in terms of what it displays in terms of giving some hope or some boost to what is and should be illegal activity,\\\" Mueller answered. \\\"Donald Trump Jr.  had direct communications with WikiLeaks during the campaign period.  On October 3, 2016.  WikiLeaks penned another message to Trump Jr.  asking: \\\"You guys to have a link to Clinton.  Julian Assange responded to that, he had already done so.   This behavior at the very least disturbing? \\\"Disturbing and also subject to investigation,\\\" Mueller said. \\\"Could it be described as aide and comfort to a hostile service, sir? ?  Quigley pressed. \\\"I wouldn't characterize it with any specificity,\\\" Mueller said. 1:41 p. m.  Republican lawmaker presses Mueller on whether attorney general has authority to exonerate TrumpRep.  Mike Turner, R-Ohio, returned to Republicans' theme of questioning Mueller's decision not to exonerate Trump, something that has frustrated the president and his allies. With a screenshot of a CNN chyron from earlier Wednesday reading \\\"Mueller: Trump was not exonerated,\\\" Turner pressed Mueller on the issue. \\\"If your report is to the attorney general and the attorney general doesn't have the power to exonerate and he does not -- he knows that you do not have that power, you don't have to tell him that you're not exonerating the president.  He knows this already.  So then that kind of changes the context of the report,\\\" he said.  \\\"The attorney general has the power to exonerate?  He has not been given that authority. \\\"\\\"No,\\\" Mueller replied.  \\\"We included in the report for exactly that reason. \\\"\\\"You have no more power to declare him exonerated than you have the power to declare him Anderson Cooper,\\\" Turner said.  \\\"The statement about exoneration is misleading and meaningless and colors this investigation.  One word out of the entire portion of your report and it's a meaningless word that has no legal meaning and it has colored your entire report. \\\"\\\"Mr.  Mueller, would you agree with me that the attorney general does not have the power to exonerate? \\\" Turner continued. \\\"I'm going to pass on that,\\\" Mueller said. \\\"Why? \\\" Turner pressed. \\\"Because it embroils us in a legal discussion.  I'm not prepared to deal with a legal discussion in that arena,\\\" Mueller answered. 1:14 p. m.  Mueller said his investigation was not a witch hunt and that Russian interference is not a hoax, as Trump has claimed\\\"Your investigation is not a witch hunt, is it? \\\" Rep.  Adam Schiff, D-Calif. , asked. \\\"It is not a witch hunt,\\\" Mueller said. \\\"When the president said the Russian interference was a hoax, that was false, wasn't it,\\\" Schiff asked. \\\"True,\\\" Mueller answered. \\\"It's also clear from your report that during that Russian outreach to the Trump campaign, no one associated with the Trump campaign ever called the FBI to report it, am I right? \\\" Schiff asked. \\\"I don't know that for sure,\\\" Mueller said. \\\"In fact, the campaign welcomed the Russian help, did they not? \\\" Schiff asked. \\\"I think we report, in the report, say indications that that occurred, yes,\\\" Mueller answered. \\\"The president's son said when he was approached about dirt on Hillary Clinton, that the Trump campaign would love it,\\\" Schiff said. \\\"That's generally what was said, yes,\\\" Mueller said. \\\"The president himself called on the Russians to hack Hillary's emails? ,\\\" Schiff said. \\\"There's a statement by the president in those general lines,\\\" Mueller responded. \\\"Numerous times during the campaign, the president praised the releases of the Russian-hacked emails through Wikileaks? \\\" Schiff asked. \\\"That did occur,\\\" Mueller said. 1:09 p. m.  Mueller corrects earlier statement to Democratic lawmaker at first hearing\\\"Now, before we go to questions, I want to go back to one thing that was said this morning by Mr.  Lieu who said, and I quote, 'You didn't charge the president because of the OLC opinion',\\\" Mueller said, referring to the Justice Department Office of Legal Counsel opinion that it was against department policy to indict a sitting president.  \\\"That is not the correct way to say it.  As we say in the report, and as I said at the opening, we did not reach a determination as to whether the president committed a crime,\\\" Mueller explained. 1 p. m.  Top Republican gives opening remarks\\\"Welcome, everyone, to the last gasp of the Russia collusion conspiracy theory,\\\" Rep.  Devin Nunes, R-Calif. , said as he began his opening statement. \\\"Among congressional Democrats, the Russia investigation was never about finding the truth,\\\" he said as he finished.  \\\"It’s always been a simple media operation, and by their own accounts, that operation continues in this room today.  Once again, numerous pressing issues this Committee needs to address are put on hold to indulge the political fantasies of people who believed it was their destiny to serve in the Hillary Clinton administration.  It’s time for the curtain to close on the Russia hoax—the conspiracy theory is dead.  At some point, I would argue, we’re going to have to get back to work,\\\" Nunes said. 12:52 p. m.  Second hearing begins before House Intelligence Committee Rep.  Adam Schiff, the California Democrat who chairs the House Intelligence Committee, gaveled in another two hours of questioning of Robert Mueller. \\\"Your report, for those who have taken the time to study it, is methodical and it is devastating, for it tells the story of a foreign adversary’s sweeping and systematic intervention in a close U. S.  presidential election,\\\" he said in an opening statement. \\\"That should be enough to deserve the attention of every American, as you well point out.  But your report tells another story as well.  For the story of the 2016 presidential election is also a story about disloyalty to country, about greed, and about lies,\\\" he continued. \\\"Your investigation determined that the Trump campaign – including Trump himself – knew that a foreign power was intervening in our election and welcomed it, built Russian meddling into their strategy, and used it. \\\"Disloyalty to country.  Those are strong words, but how else are we to describe a presidential campaign which did not inform the authorities of a foreign offer of dirt on their opponent, which did not publicly shun it, or turn it away, but which instead invited it, encouraged it, and made full use of it? \\\" he said. 12:10 p. m.  First hearing endsMueller finished his testimony before the House Judiciary Committee after more than three hours of questioning.  After a break, Mueller would be testifying before members of the House Intelligence Committee about the section of his report dealing with whether there was collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russian government or individuals tied to that government. 12:07 p. m.  Mueller declines to comment on impeachment question\\\"Director Mueller, at your May 29, 2019, press conference, you explained that, quote, 'The opinion says that the Constitution requires a process other than the criminal justice system to formally accuse a sitting president of wrongdoing,' end quote.  That process, other than the criminal justice system for accusing a president of wrongdoing, is that impeachment? \\\", Rep.  Veronica Escobar, D-Texas, asked. She was the last Democrat to ask a question. \\\"I'm not going to comment on that,\\\" Mueller answered. \\\"In your report, you also wrote that you did not want to, quote, 'potentially preempt constitutional processes for addressing presidential misconduct,' end quote.  For the non-lawyers in the room, what did you mean by, quote, 'potentially preempt constitutional processes'? \\\"\\\"I'm not going to try to explain that,\\\" Mueller responded. \\\"That actually is coming from page 1 of Volume II.  In the footnote is the reference to this.  What are those constitutional processes? \\\" she pressed. \\\"I think I heard you mention at least one,\\\" Mueller answered. 12:01 p. m.  Democratic lawmaker questions Barr's summary of the Mueller report \\\"Could Attorney General Barr have avoided public confusion if he had released your summaries and executive introduction and summaries,\\\" Rep.  Madeleine Dean, D-Penn. , asked, referring to Barr's letter stating, in his view, the \\\"principal conclusions\\\" of Mueller's report, several weeks before the redacted report was released. \\\"I don't feel comfortable speculating on that,\\\" Mueller said, although he did send a letter to Barr stating his concerns that his report had been mischaracterized. 11:53 a. m.  Republicans end their questioning on impeachment issue A key question since his report was issued has been whether Mueller, because he believed he could not indict a sitting president, intended for Congress to deal with the issue through possible impeachment, according to the Constitution. \\\"One last important question.  Your report does not recommend impeachment.  Does it? \\\" Rep.  Mike Johnson, R-La. , asked. \\\"I'm not going to talk about recommendations,\\\" Mueller said. \\\"It does not conclude that impeachment would be appropriate here, right,\\\" Johnson added. \\\"I'm not going to talk about that issue,\\\" Mueller answered. 11:43 a. m.  Mueller emphatically defends his prosecution team against claims of political bias\\\"You must be aware by now that six of your lawyers donated $12,000 directly to Hillary Clinton.  I'm not even talking about the $49,000 they donated to other Democrats.  Just the donations to the opponent who was the target of your investigation,\\\" Rep.  Kelly Armstrong, R-N. D. , said. \\\"We strove to hire those individuals that could do the job.  I've been in this business for almost 25 years, and in those 25 years, I have not had occasion once to ask somebody about their political affiliation.  It is not done.  What I care about is the capability of the individual to do the job and do the job quickly and seriously and with integrity,\\\" Mueller said. 11:32 a. m.  Mueller denies he applied for job as FBI director \\\"A day before being named special counsel, did you indeed interview for the FBI director job one day before you were appointed special counsel? ,\\\" Rep.  Greg Steube, R-Fla. , asked, repeating a claim President Trump has made multiple times as evidence Mueller was \\\"conflicted\\\" and biased, allegedly because Trump rejected him. \\\"My understanding - it was not applying for the job.  I was asked to give my input on what it would take to do the job, which triggered the interview you're talking about,\\\" Mueller answered. \\\"So you don't recall on May 16, 2017, that you interviewed with the president regarding the FBI director job,\\\" Steube said, reminding Mueller that he was under oath. \\\"I interviewed with the president,\\\" Mueller said. \\\"Was it about the FBI director job? \\\" Steube added. \\\"It was about the job, not me applying for the job,\\\" Mueller said. \\\"So, did you tell the vice president that the FBI director position would be the one job that you would come back for? \\\" Steube asked. \\\"I don't recall that one,\\\" Mueller answered. 11:17 a. m.  Mueller pushes back on how GOP lawmaker characterizes his report\\\"Well, what you did is you compiled a nearly 450 pages of the very worst information you gathered against the target of your investigation, who happens to be the president of the United States.  And you did this knowing that you were not going to recommend charges and that the report would be made public,\\\" Rep.  Guy Reschenthaler, R-Penn. , said. \\\"Not true,\\\" Mueller responded. 10:58 a. m.  Mueller defends his report\\\"The fundamental problem is, as I said, we've got to take your word, that your team, faithfully, accurately, impartially, and completely described all of the underlying evidence in the Mueller report, and we're finding more and more instances where this just isn't the case.  And it's starting to look like, you know, having desperately tried and failed to make a legal case against the president, you made a political case instead. You put it in a paper sack, lit it on fire, dropped it on our porch, rang the doorbell, and ran,\\\" Rep.  Tom McClintock, R-Calif. , said. \\\"I don't think you’ve reviewed a report that is as thorough, as fair, as consistent as the report that we have in front of us,\\\" Mueller responded. 10:52 a. m.  Mueller explains why he did not indict Trump\\\"And I'd like to ask you the reason, again, that you did not indict Donald Trump is because of OLC opinion stating that you cannot indict a sitting president, correct,\\\" Rep.  Ted Lieu, D-Calif. , asked, referring to a Justice Department Office of Legal Counsel opinion that it was DOJ policy that a sitting president cannot be indicted. \\\"That is correct,\\\" Mueller said. 10:37 a. m.  Mueller said prosecutors can bring a charge of obstruction after a president leaves officeIn an especially significant moment, the former special counsel answered one of the key outstanding questions about his report during questioning by a Republican. \\\"Could you charge the president with a crime after he left office? \\\" Rep.  Ken Buck, R-Colo. , asked. \\\"Yes,\\\" Mueller said. \\\"You believe that he committed -- you could charge the president of the United States with obstruction of justice after he left office? \\\" Buck asked again. \\\"Yes,\\\" Mueller answered. 10:23 a. m.  Republican challenges Mueller on credibility of Christopher Steele\\\"I'm quoting from the Steele dossier, extensive evidence of conspiracy between the Trump campaign team and the Kremlin.  So here's my question: Did Russians really tell that to Christopher Steele or did he just make it all up and was he lying to the FBI,\\\" Rep.  Matt Gaetz, R-Fla. , asked. \\\"Let me back up a second if I could and say as I have said earlier with regard to the Steele -- that's beyond my purview,\\\" Mueller said. 10:06 a. m.  The committee takes a short breakSo far, there have been 21 instances of Mueller saying \\\"refer to the report,\\\" \\\"I'll leave that to our report,\\\" \\\"I direct you to the report,\\\" \\\"I'll leave the answer to the report,\\\" \\\"rely on the language of the report\\\"  -- answers along the lines of his previous statement that his report would be his \\\"testimony\\\" and that he would not go beyond it. 9:47 a. m.  Democrat asks about Trump's intention in wanting to fire Mueller\\\"Director Mueller, you found evidence as you lay out in your report that the president wanted to fire you because you were investigating him for obstruction of justice, isn't that correct,\\\" Rep.  Ted Deutch, D-Fla. , said. \\\"That's what it says in the report.  And yes, I stand by the report,\\\" Mueller said. Deutch then pivoted to ask Mueller about his report's finding that Trump ordered then-White House counsel Don McGhan to have then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions fire Mueller. \\\"You found White House counsel McGahn to be a credible witness, isn't that correct? \\\" Deutch said. \\\"Correct,\\\" Muller said. \\\"Director Mueller, the most important question I have for you today is why Director Mueller, why did the president of the United States want you fired? \\\" Deutch asked. \\\"I can't answer that question,\\\" Muller answered. 9:39 a. m.  Republican lawmaker asks Mueller about Peter Strzok controversy\\\"Peter Strzok hated Trump.  You didn't know that before he was made part of your team, is that what you're saying,\\\" Rep.  Louie Gohmert, R-Texas, asked about the former FBI agent who exchanged derogatory texts with former FBI lawyer Lisa Page, with whom he was having an affair. House Republicans and President Trump have repeatedly cited Strzok as evidence that Mueller's investigation was biased from the start. \\\"I did not know that.  And when I did find out, I acted swiftly to have him reassigned,\\\" Mueller answered. 9:08 a. m.  Republican argues Mueller didn't give Trump presumption of innocence Rep.  John Ratcliffe, R-Texas, a former U. S.  attorney, has a pointed back-and-forth with Mueller. He \\\"respectfully\\\" criticized Mueller's comments about not exonerating Trump in the report. \\\"Respectfully, respectfully, it was not the special counsel's job to conclusively determine President Trump's innocence,\\\" he said, \\\"because there is a presumption of innocence, prosecutors never, ever, need to determine it. \\\"\\\"Nowhere in here did it say write a report about decisions that weren't reached,\\\" Ratcliffe said. \\\"Americans need to know this as they listen to the Democrats and socialists on the other side of this aisle . . .  volume II was not authorized to be written under this law. \\\"\\\"Donald Trump is not above the law, but he damn sure shouldn't be below the law. \\\"9 a. m.  Top Republican presses Mueller on collusion\\\"Collusion is not a specific offense or a term of art in federal criminal law.  Conspiracy is.  In the colloquial context, collusion and conspiracy are essentially synonymous terms, correct? \\\" Rep.  Doug Collins, R-Ga. , asked. \\\"No,\\\" Mueller said. \\\"On page 180, Volume 1 of your report, it said collusion is largely synonymous with conspiracy as that crime is set forth.  Now, you said you chose your words carefully.  Are you contradicting your report right now? \\\" Collins asked. \\\"Not when I read it,\\\" Mueller answered. \\\"So, you would change your answer to yes, then? \\\" Collins asked. \\\"No,\\\" Mueller said. \\\"I'm reading your report, sir.  Is it a yes or no answer.  Page 180, Volume 1.  This is from your report,\\\" Collins added. \\\"Correct.  And I leave it with the report,\\\" Mueller said. 8:52 a. m.  Chairman Nadler asks the first question \\\"Director Mueller, the president has repeatedly claimed that your report found there was no obstruction and that it, completely and totally exonerated him.  But that is not what your report said, is it? \\\" Rep.  Jerry Nadler, D-N. Y. , asked. \\\"Right, that is not what the report said,\\\" Mueller said. Nadler then asks if the report totally exonerates Trump of obstruction of justice as the president has claimed. \\\"So.  the report did not conclude that he did not commit obstruction of justice?  Is that correct,\\\" Nadler said. \\\"That is correct,\\\" Mueller answered. \\\"And what about total exoneration?  Did you actually totally exonerate the president,\\\" Nadler asked. \\\"No,\\\" Mueller said. 8:42 a. m.  Mueller is sworn in\\\"It is unusual for a prosecutor to testify on a criminal investigation.  And given my role as a prosecutor there are reasons why my testimony will necessarily be limited,\\\" Mueller said in his opening statement. \\\"I also will not comment on the actions of the Attorney General or of Congress.   I was appointed as a prosecutor, and I intend to adhere to that role and to the Department’s standards that govern it,\\\" Mueller added. 8:36 a. m.  Judiciary Chairman Nadler gives opening statement\\\"Director Mueller, we have a responsibility to address the evidence that you have uncovered.  You recognize as much when you said, 'The Constitution requires a process other than the criminal justice system to formally accuse a sitting president of wrongdoing. ' That process begins with the work of this committee,\\\" Rep.  Jerry Nadler, D-N. Y. , said. \\\"This hearing is long overdue.  We’ve had the truth for months — no American conspired to throw our elections.  What we need today is to let that truth bring us confidence and closure,\\\" Rep.  Doug Collins, the top Republican on the committee, said in his opening statement. 8:33 a. m.  Mueller takes the witness chairIn a packed hearing room, Mueller takes a seat in the witness chair.  A top aide, Aaron Zebley, takes a seat just behind him. Shortly after Mueller sat down, a protester shouted: “Kushner and Manafort downloaded encrypted apps the day of the Trump Tower meeting” before getting pulled out of the room by Capitol Police. 7:53 a. m.  Mueller arrives on Capitol HillMueller arrived amid a crush of reporters and cameras for his congressional testimony in front of the House Judiciary Committee but made no comment. Mueller testifies first before the Judiciary Committee for three hours, before fielding questions from the House Intelligence Committee for two hours.  The first hearing will focus on Volume II of the Mueller report, which detailed ten instances of possible obstruction of justice by President Trump.  The second hearing will center on Volume I of the report, which focused on Russian efforts to interfere in the 2016 White House race. Lawmakers have spent weeks preparing for the hearings, and continued to prepare for the back-to-back rounds of questioning well into Tuesday evening, fielding a last-minute request from Mueller that Aaron Zebley, his longtime chief of staff, be sworn in to appear alongside him in front of the committees.  A committee spokesman said Zebley would appear with Mueller on Wednesday as his counsel. Democrats and Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee have each held mock hearings, with committee staffers playing the role of Mueller.  The former special counsel has prepared with a cadre of longtime aides at the WilmerHale law firm, where he worked before accepting the special counsel appointment. Trump has attacked Mueller ahead of the hearing, and said he may \\\"see a little bit of it\\\" on television. On Monday, the Justice Department attempted to limit elements of Mueller’s testimony, saying in a letter to the former special counsel that he \\\"must remain within the boundaries\\\" of the public report on his investigation. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events\",\n  \"document_ocr\": \"abc\\nNEWS\\n\",\n  \"Category\": \"Insufficient_Text\"\n}, {\n  \"Id\": 34872,\n  \"claim_image\": \"http://pbs.twimg.com/media/EPR9C9VWoAIIGVw.jpg?format=jpg&name=large\",\n  \"claim\": \"The #Grammys is traditionally one of the most bold and outrageous award ceremonies, fashion-wise.

This is the story of Kobe Bryant’s life Basketball legend Kobe Bryant is among nine people who died in a helicopter crash in the wealthy Southern California residential neighborhood of Calabasas, ABC News has confirmed. Bryant's 13-year-old daughter, Gianna, died alongside her father, NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said in a statement. Bryant was 41 years old. There were no survivors in the crash around 10 a. m.  local time Sunday, fire officials said in a press conference. Orange Coast College head baseball coach John Altobelli was also on board the aircraft, the school said in a statement.  The family later confirmed Altobelli's wife, Keri, and daughter, Alyssa, were also among those killed. The names of the other victims will not be publicly identified until next-of-kin are notified, Los Angeles County Sheriff Alex Villanueva told reporters. \\\"God bless their souls,\\\" Villanueva said, adding that members from the coroner's office are on their way to assist in the recovery of the remains. The Sikorsky S-76 helicopter crashed under unknown circumstances, a spokesperson from the National Transportation Safety Board told ABC News.  Firefighters worked to contain the quarter-acre brush fire that resulted, which was difficult to extinguish due to the presence of magnesium, which reacts to oxygen and water, Los Angeles County Fire Chief Daryl Osby told reporters. The debris from the aircraft was scattered on steep terrain, Osby said.  Paramedics on board an air ambulance were hoisted down to the scene but were not able to locate any survivors, he added. Witnesses who were mountain biking in the area saw the helicopter in distress, Los Angeles County Fire Capt.  Tony Imbrenda told reporters.  It is not known whether the pilot alerted over radio that the aircraft was in distress, Imbrenda said. It is unclear who the helicopter belonged to or where it originated from and was going to.  The National Transportation Safety Board and Federal Aviation Administration are investigating the crash. The FBI will also be helping the NTSB in its investigation because it has evidence response teams. While the cause of the crash is still unclear, the Los Angeles Police Department told ABC News it was not flying choppers on Sunday morning since the weather, specifically visibility, did not meet LAPD’s standards for flying. Bryant was drafted to the NBA out of high school in 1996 and spent his entire 20-year career with the Los Angeles Lakers, winning five NBA championships.  He was awarded NBA MVP in 2008 and NBA Finals MVP in 2009 and 2010. Bryant won gold medals as a member of the U. S.  men's basketball team in the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing and the 2012 Summer Olympics in London. LeBron James surpassed Bryant on the all-time scoring list on Saturday during the Lakers' game against the Philadelphia 76ers. \\\"I'm happy just to be in any conversation with Kobe Bean Bryant -- one of the all-time greatest basketball players to ever play, one of the all-time greatest Lakers,\\\" James told reporters after the game.  \\\"The man got two jerseys hanging up in Staples Center.  It's just crazy. \\\"Bryant tweeted at James congratulating him on beating his record. In 2018, Bryant won an Academy Award for his animated short \\\"Dear Basketball,\\\" based on a poem he wrote in 2015 when he announced his retirement. Bryant told \\\"Good Morning America\\\" anchor Robin Roberts in December 2015 that he wrote a letter to his fans upon retirement because he wanted to show how much they meant to him. \\\"The letter itself still doesn't do it justice and how important they've been -- how vital they've been in my career,\\\" he said.  \\\"And I mean, we grew up together.  And that's such a beautiful thing. \\\"Bryant was embroiled in controversy during a 2005 trial when he was accused of sexual assault by an employee at a Vail, Colorado, hotel.  Bryant always denied the encounter was nonconsensual and the case was later dismissed after the victim said she did not want to testify and the two parties settled a civil suitSilver said in a statement that the \\\"NBA family is devastated by the tragic passing\\\" of Bryant and his daughter and offered condolences to Bryant's wife, Vanessa, and their family. \\\"For 20 seasons, Kobe showed us what is possible when remarkable talent blends with an absolute devotion to winning,\\\" Silver's statement read.  \\\"He was one of the most extraordinary players in the history of our game with accomplishments that are legendary:  five NBA championships, an NBA MVP award, 18 NBA All-Star selections, and two Olympic gold medals.  But he will be remembered most for inspiring people around the world to pick up a basketball and compete to the very best of their ability.  He was generous with the wisdom he acquired and saw it as his mission to share it with future generations of players, taking special delight in passing down his love of the game to Gianna. \\\"Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti described Bryant in a statement as a \\\"giant who inspired, amazed, and thrilled people everywhere with his incomparable skill on the court -- and awed us with his intellect and humility as father, husband, creative genius, and ambassador for the game he loved. \\\"\\\"He will live forever in the heart of Los Angeles, and will be remembered through the ages as one of our greatest heroes,\\\" Garcetti said.  \\\"This is a moment that leaves us struggling to find words that express the magnitude of shock and sorrow we are all feeling right now, and I am keeping Kobe's entire family in my prayers at this time of unimaginable grief. \\\"The Lakers' next game will be against the Los Angeles Clippers Tuesday at the Staples Center at 7 p. m.  PT. Fans flocked to the scene of the crash, the Staples Center and the Kobe Bryant Gymnasium at the Lower Merion High School in Ardmore, Pennsylvania, where Bryant played basketball prior to being drafted, to mourn the fallen NBA star. In a statement, the school praised Bryant to raising \\\"the profiled of the high school\\\" and the school district, according to ABC Philadelphia station WPVI.  Bryant led the team to the 1996 state championship. \\\"Our school community will always be grateful for his ongoing generosity to his alma mater, including his dedication of our Kobe Bryant Gymnasium and his support of our boys' and girls' basketball teams. The NBA Player's Association wrote in a statement that it was \\\"stunned and devastated\\\" by the news of Bryant's death. \\\"Words cannot express his impact on our Players, the NBA and the game of basketball,\\\" the statement read.  \\\"This is a monumental loss for the entire basketball community and our hearts are quite simply broken.  We send love and prayers out to his wife Vanessa and the entire family. \\\"ABC News' Matthew Furhman, Matthew Foster, Darren Reynolds and Matthew Vann contributed to this report. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events\",\n  \"document_ocr\": \"NEWS\\nwww. - Y\\nTWTESNOT\\nOMEMGRILL\\nESCOM\\n能ton\\nFed: forum\\n\",\n  \"Category\": \"Insufficient_Text\"\n}, {\n  \"Id\": 34873,\n  \"claim_image\": \"http://pbs.twimg.com/media/EeAQCkYUMAIT8--.jpg?format=jpg&name=large\",\n  \"claim\": \"BSP to file plea in Rajasthan High Court tomorrow against merger of its MLAs with Congress\\n\\nhttps://t.co/Wlff13nt4F https://t.co/t8RVsv9izg\",\n  \"claim_ocr\": \"SP's B\\nRook\\\"\\nment K\\nrnama\\ny Strug\\ndden I\\nNe\\n\",\n  \"document_image\": \"http://pbs.twimg.com/media/EcySNORUcAA0JYb.jpg?format=jpg&name=large\",\n  \"document\": \"Mayawati-led Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) will file a plea in Rajasthan High Court tomorrow against the merger of its MLAs in the state with the Congress.

She said that the BSP supported the Congress unconditionally after the Assembly elections in Rajasthan.  “In Rajasthan, after elections results, the BSP gave unconditional support of all its six MLAs to Congress.  Unfortunately, chief minister Ashok Gehlot, out of his malicious intent and to damage the BSP, merged them with Congress in an unconstitutional.  He did the same even in his last tenure,” Mayawati said on Tuesday.  She said that the MLAs in question will lose their party membership if they don’t vote against the Congress in proceedings to be held during the assembly Session.  She said the party is willing to even move the Supreme Court.   BJP leader Madan Dilwar files another petition before Rajasthan High Court against the merger of six BSP MLAs in the state with Congress party.

Meanwhile, BJP leader Madan Dilawar on Tuesday filed another petition before the Rajasthan High Court against the BSP MLAs merger with Congress party.  This is his third petition against the merger.  In a relief to the Gehlot government, the High Court had dismissed Dilawar’s petition on Monday.

She should ready a letter pad with the words 'former CM' written on it,” Adhikari, who crossed over to the BJP recently, said while addressing a rally in Purba Medinipur district's Khejuri. Banerjee had said on Monday she will contest the assembly elections from both Nandigram and Bhawanipore constituencies.  Banerjee said that Nandigram is close to her heart and continues to remain special.  “Bhawanipore is my elder sister and Nandigram is my younger sister.  I will try to contest from both assembly constituencies.  The people of Bhawanipore may feel bad.  But I don’t want to hurt them.  If I can manage (to contest from both constituencies) it is okay.  But I will contest from Nandigram,” Banerjee had said at a rally in Nandigram on Monday. The war of words between Adhikari and Banerjee began soon after the chief minister’s announcement.  Adhikari challenged Mamata on Monday saying that he will resign from politics if he cannot defeat the Bengal chief minister by more than 50,000 votes.  “Write this down and mention the date and time.  I will leave politics if I cannot defeat her by half lakh (50,000) votes,” Adhikari said while addressing a rally in south Kolkata on the same day. The Bengal chief minister’s announcement has brought back Nandigram once more into the spotlight.  Nandigram remains important for both the chief minister and Suvendu Adhikari as the movement to protect farmers’ lands from acquisition 13 years ago catapulted both of them into the nation’s political stage. Adhikari was responsible for building the Trinamool Congress’ voter base in Jangalmahal, Nandigram and Purba Medinipur as the party’s youth leader.  Adhikari since joining the BJP in December has vowed to remove the Banerjee's government from power. Bengal will hold elections this year but incidents of political violence have cast a shadow over the polling process.  Buoyed by its performance in the state in the Lok Sabha elections in 2019, the state’s BJP unit remains confident that it will oust Banerjee from power in West Bengal assembly elections. \",\n  \"document_ocr\": \"\",\n  \"Category\": \"Insufficient_Text\"\n}, {\n  \"Id\": 34875,\n  \"claim_image\": \"http://pbs.twimg.com/media/EPFqJvjX0AATwqY.jpg?format=jpg&name=large\",\n  \"claim\": \"\\\"That to me is the most chilling. ...

Trump’s defense team makes case for just 2 hoursPresident Donald Trump's defense team makes first day of opening arguments Trump's lawyers argue the charges are not impeachable, raise the Bidens Trump has called the Saturday trial session \\\"Death Valley in T. V. \\\" President Donald Trump's legal team Saturday took to the Senate floor to argue against the case made by the House impeachment managers over the past three days. The president’s lawyers also will have 24 hours over three days to persuade senators that the articles of impeachment charged -- abuse of power and obstruction of Congress -- do not amount to impeachable offenses. As Jay Sekulow, the president's personal attorney, predicted, they briefly brought up former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter, after Democrats raised them repeatedly in an effort to preempt the expected White House defense. They have argued that the president was justified in seeking an investigation into the Bidens by Ukraine because of a history of corruption involving the Ukrainian energy company Burisma. Sekulow has said his team plans to save the bulk of their defense for their second day of arguments on Monday.  He was accompanied by White House counsel Pat Cipollone and other White House lawyers on Saturday in an abbreviated session that lasted only about two hours. “Next week is when you’ll see the full presentation,” Sekulow told reporters Friday. Sekulow's comment came on the heels of a tweet by Trump equating Saturdays to “Death Valley in T. V. ”, signaling that he doesn't want his lawyers to deliver the case on Saturday when fewer people might be watching. Before Saturday's session began, Trump tweeted how Americans could watch his lawyers defend him. Here is how the day unfolded. Just before Cipollone ends the Trump team presentation for the day, he once again targets Schiff by recalling that Independent Counsel Ken Starr testified before the House during the Clinton impeachment. \\\"Do you know who else didn't show up in the Judiciary Committee to answer questions about his report in the way Ken Starr did in the Clinton impeachment?  Ken Starr was subjected to cross-examination by the president's counsel,\\\" Cipollone says.  \\\"Do you know who didn't show up in the Judiciary Committee?  Chairman Schiff. \\\"\\\"Now, they've come here today and they basically said let's cancel an election over a meeting with the Ukraine, with Ukraine,\\\" Cipollone says.  \\\"And as my colleagues have shown, they failed to give you key facts about the meeting and lots of other evidence that they produced themselves. \\\"\\\"Impeachment shouldn't be a shell game,\\\" Cipollone says.  \\\"They should give you the facts. \\\"In his closing remarks, Sekulow says,\\\"Impeachment shouldn't be a shell game.  We ask you, out of respect, to think about whether what you've heard would really suggest to anybody anything other that would be completely irresponsible abuse of power to do what they're asking you to do.  To stop an election, to interfere in an election, and remove the President of the United States from the ballot?  Let the people decide for themselves.  That's what the founders wanted.  That's what we should all want,\\\" he says. Deputy White House counsel Patrick Philbin begins by talking about \\\"issues related to obstruction and due process,\\\" outlining what he says are errors with the process in which the House handled the impeachment inquiry. He says House Speaker Nancy Pelosi didn't have the authority to begin impeaching the president without a full vote of the House. \\\"House Democrats skipped over that step completely.  What they had instead was simply a press conference from Speaker Pelosi announcing that she was directing committees to proceed with an impeachment inquiry against the President of the United States.  Speaker Pelosi didn't have the authority to delegate the power of the house to those committees on her own,\\\" he says. \\\"All of those subpoenas were invalid.  And that is what the Trump administration pointed out specifically to the house.  That was the reason for not responding to them because under long-settled precedent, there had to be a vote from the House to give authority. \\\"Philbin says the idea that President Trump was offered due process is \\\"simply inaccurate\\\" and claims that 78 days in the House is the fastest impeachment inquiry in U. S.  history. \\\"The president was given a choice of participating in a process that was going to already have the outcome determined.  The speaker had already said articles of impeachment we going to be drafted.  And there were no plans to hear from any fact witnesses.  That's not due process.  And that's why the president declined to participate in that process because the Judiciary Committee had already decided they were going to accept an ex parte record developed in manager Schiff's process, and there was no point in participating in that. \\\"\\\"They really weren't really interested in getting at the facts and the truth.  They had a timetable to meet.  They wanted to have impeachment done by Christmas, and that's what they were striving to do,\\\" he adds. Philbin criticizes that the whistleblower complaint has not been made public, an attack that many Republicans have echoed throughout the investigation. “We know from a letter that the inspector general of the intelligence community sent that he thought that the whistleblower had political bias,” Philbin says. ABC News’ Senior Congressional Correspondent Mary Bruce reports from inside the Senate Chamber:What a difference a day makes.  The Chamber appears to have woken up.  Both sides are paying very close attention.  From my vantage point, I didn't see a single empty chair. There's a lot more note-taking all around, but I am struck by how closely Democrats are paying attention today, especially compared to days past.  Many more of them are taking detailed notes.  And we know they have already begun submitting questions for the 16 hours of questioning that comes next. On the Republican side, the president's allies look quite pleased.

Collins, Murkowski and Romney who appear to be paying the closest attention on the GOP side. One other big difference -- the public seats are packed today.  Americans of all ages, intently listening as they observe history unfolding on the floor. \\\"Let me begin by saying that you cannot simply decide this case in a vacuum.  Mr.  Schiff said yesterday -- I believe it was his father who said -- you should put yourself in someone else's shoes.  Let's for a moment put ourselves in the shoes of the President of the United States right now,\\\" Jay Sekulow says. “Disagreeing with the president's decision on foreign policy matters or whose advice he's going to take is in no way an impeachable offense,” Sekulow says. Sekulow says that Democrats base their quid pro quo argument off the basis that a White House meeting between Trump and Zelenskiy did not happen. \\\"As if an article of impeachment could be based upon a meeting not taking place in the White House, but taking place someplace else like the United Nations General Assembly where it, in fact, did take place,\\\" he says. Sekulow also walks through President Trump's foreign policy toward other countries, attempting to show Ukraine was not treated any differently from others under Trump's foreign policy focused on \\\"burden-sharing. \\\"Sekulow argues that eliminating corruption in Ukraine was a central goal in U. S.  policy in Ukraine to explain Trump's motives. \\\"I am not going to continue to go over and over and over again the evidence that they did not put before you because we would be here for a lot longer than 24 hours.  But to say that the president of the United States did not -- was not concerned about burden sharing, that he was not concerned about corruption in Ukraine, the facts from their hearing, the facts from their hearing, establish exactly the opposite,\\\" Sekulow says. \\\"As everyone knows by now, President Trump asked President Zelenskiy to do 'us' a favor,\\\" Purpura says.  \\\"And he made clear that 'us' referred to our country, and not himself,\\\" he says, repeated a claim Trump had made himself in a tweet that Democrats dispute. \\\"There was no mention of the paused security assistance on the call and certainly not from President Trump,\\\" he says. Purpura homes in on comments made by Timothy Morrison, the former National Security Council Russia Director Republicans called to testify in the House Intelligence Committee's impeachment inquiry. \\\"Mr.  Morrison further testified that there was nothing improper and nothing illegal about anything that was said on the call.  In fact, Mr.  Morrison repeatedly testified that he disagreed with Lieutenant Colonel Vindman's assessment that President Trump made demands of President Zelenskiy or that he said anything improper at all,\\\" Purpura says, before playing a clip from Morrison's testimony. Purpura argues there was \\\"no quid pro quo on the call\\\" because Ukrainians weren't aware of the paused security assistance until Politico reported on it in August. \\\"There were numerous high-level diplomatic meetings between senior Ukrainian and U. S.  officials during the summer after the review on the security assistance began, but before President Zelenskiy learned of the hold through the Politico article.  If the Ukrainians had known about the hold, they would have raised it in one of those meetings, yet the Ukrainians didn't say anything about the hold at a single one of those meeting,\\\" Purpura says.  \\\"As soon as Ukrainians learned about the hold, they asked about it. \\\"(Democrats have pointed to testimony from two House witnesses to indicate that Ukraine was aware of the hold before the August article. )“The Democrats entire quid pro quo theory is based on nothing more than the initial speculation of one person.  Ambassador Sondland.  That speculation is wrong,” Purpura says, referring to the U. S.  Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland who has testified he was in direct contact with President Trump about the Ukraine aid matter. (The person who actually directed the White House Office of Management and Budget to withhold the military aid to Ukraine -- acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney -- explicitly acknowledged the quid pro quo in the White House briefing room on Oct.  17, 2019. )\\\"The House managers are aware that the Ukrainians lack of knowledge on the hold is fatal to their case, so they desperately tried to muddy the water,\\\" he says. Purpura argues that none of the witnesses called to testify in the House inquiry could say definitively whether the withheld security aid was tied to investigations into the Bidens. Another member of the president's legal team, Mike Purpura, opens his presentation with a video from November of lead House impeachment manager Adam Schiff  in which he reads a parody  version of the July 25 phone call transcript, comparing it to an organized crime \\\"shakedown. \\\"(Schiff, before speaking, said he was summarizing the \\\"essence\\\" of Trump's comments \\\"shorn of its rambling character,\\\" Schiff said. )Ukraine didn't know about the aid, he said, playing Volker and Taylor's testimony about Ukrainians questioning them about the hold following the August Politico article. (Democrats have pointed to testimony from two House witnesses – Cooper and Croft – to indicate that Ukraine was aware of the hold before the August article. )“The Democrats entire quid pro quo theory is based on nothing more than the initial speculation of one person.  Ambassador Sondland.  That speculation is wrong,” he said.  [10:55:08 AM]\\\"Once you sweep away all of the bluster and innuendo, the selective leaks, the closed-door examinations of the Democrats' hand-picked witnesses, the staged public hearings, what we're left with are six key facts that have not and will not change,\\\" Purpura says. He then lays out what he calls the \\\"six key facts. \\\"\\\"First, the transcript shows that the president did not condition either security assistance or a meeting on anything.  Second, President Zelenskiy and other Ukrainian officials repeatedly have said there was no quid pro quo and no pressure on them to review anything.  Third, President Zelenskiy and high-ranking Ukrainian officials did not even know -- did not even know -- the security assistance was paused until the end of August.  Over a month after the July 25 call.  Fourth, not a single witness testified that the president himself said that there was any connection between any investigations in security assistance, a presidential meeting or anything else.  Fifth, the security assistance flowed on September 11th, and a presidential meeting took place on September 25 without the Ukrainian government announcing any investigations. \\\"Finally, the Democrats' blind drive to impeach the president does not and cannot change the fact as attested to by the Democrats' own witnesses that President Trump has been a better friend and stronger supporter of Ukraine than his predecessor,\\\" he says. \\\"When it comes to sending U. S.  taxpayer money overseas, the president is focused on burden-sharing, and corruption,\\\" he argues.  \\\"There is absolutely nothing wrong with asking a foreign leader to help get to the bottom of our forms of foreign interference in American presidential election. \\\"Cipollone says \\\"they hid evidence from you. \\\"He says the president's team will show evidence that House managers \\\"decided over their three days and 24 hours that they didn't have enough time -- or made a decision not -- to show you.  And every time you see one of these pieces of evidence, ask yourself, 'why didn't I see that in the first 3 days. 'Cipollone cites a transcript of July 25, phone call between President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy -- saying Democrats did not mention how they discussed that European nations were not doing enough to support Ukraine. \\\"They come here to the Senate and they ask you, remove a president, tear up the ballots in all of your states, and they don't bother to read the key evidence of the discussion of burden-sharing that's in the call itself.  Now, that's emblematic of their entire presentation,\\\" Cipollone says.  \\\"They have the burden of proof.  And they have not come close to meeting it. \\\"\\\"We are going to be very respectful of your time. . . \\\" says White House counsel Pat Cipollone as he begins what he says will be a limited presentation. \\\"You heard the House managers speak for nearly 24 hours over three days,\\\" he says.  \\\"We don't anticipate using that much time. \\\"Then he comes out swinging against the House managers' arguments. \\\"We don't believe that they have come anywhere close to meeting their burden for what they're asking you to do,\\\" he tells senators. \\\"They're asking you not only to overturn the results of the last election, but as I've said before, they're asking you to remove President Trump from the ballot in an election that's occurring in approximately nine months,\\\" he says.  \\\"They're asking to you do something that no senate has ever done.  And they're asking to you do it with no evidence. \\\"\\\"The American people decide elections,\\\" Cipollone adds.  \\\"They have that coming up in nine months. \\\"\\\"So we will be very efficient.  We will begin our presentation today.  We will show you a lot of evidence that they should have showed you, and we will finish efficiently and quickly so that we can all go have an election,\\\" he says. ABC News' Benjamin Siegel reports, in a call with reporters earlier this morning, House Democrats said they expect the arguments from Trump’s legal team to be a “master class” in “distraction” and a “distortion” of truth. \\\"Just before the trial resumes, House manager Jerry Nadler and House staffers brought over carts of documents and legal files. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events\",\n  \"document_ocr\": \"LIVE NEWS SPECIAL REPORT\\nIMPEACHMENT TRIAL OF PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP abc\\nITEO\\n\",\n  \"Category\": \"Insufficient_Text\"\n}, {\n  \"Id\": 34876,\n  \"claim_image\": \"http://pbs.twimg.com/media/ErcQ1NTVgAEfH_b.jpg?format=jpg&name=large\",\n  \"claim\": \"Indian Medical Association (IMA) has requested all its 3.5 lakh members in 1800 local branches to voluntarily come out to get vaccinated first to show to the world that the vaccines are safe and efficacious: IMA https://t.co/DHIs42lCKA\",\n  \"claim_ocr\": \"INDIAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION (HQs.)\\nDr\\n(Registered under the Societies Act XXI of 1860)\\nMutually Affiliated with the British & Nepal Medical Associations\\nIMA House, Indraprastha Marg, New Delhi-110 002\\nTelephones +91-11-2337 0009 (10 ines), 23378680 / +91-9999116375, 9999116376, Fax +91-11-23379470\\nWebsite www.ima-india.org: Email: hsg@ima-india.org\\ntional President\\nr.

The first countrywide drill covering 74 districts was held on January 2.  “The lessons learnt from the earlier exercise will be made use to execute another dry run.

Vardhan, who faced questions about the timeline for receiving vaccine shots at the meeting, added: “It [supply of vaccines] is in works, and we will intimate you [states/UTs] all soon as we are moving towards the final stages of vaccination in the country. ” His remarks came on the day the Union health ministry said in a communique that states and UTs are likely to receive the first supply of Covid-19 vaccines shortly and asked them to remain prepared to accept the consignments.  India’s drug regulator on January 3 approved the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine and the indigenously developed Bharat Biotech vaccine for restricted emergency use in the country.

The expanding partnership between Chinese and Pakistani navies will also play an important role in maintaining peace in the IOR, Admiral M Amjad Khan Niazi told Chinese state media in an interview. Asked if China is building a naval base in Pakistan, Niazi said visits by navies will not change the “commercial” nature of the Beijing-built Gwadar port, even as he welcomed the visit of Chinese naval ships including aircraft carriers to Pakistani ports. He was speaking to the Chinese nationalist tabloid Global Times ahead of the multinational naval exercise AMAN-2021 to be hosted by Pakistan in February, where dozens of navies including from the US, UK, Japan, and Russia are expected to participate. Besides the multilateral exercise, the two countries have a bilateral naval drill “Sea Guardians”, the last edition of which was held in the northern Arabian Sea in January 2020. In the interview, Niazi accused India of destabilising the region, without evidence.  “On our eastern side, India, with an expansionist mindset, is destabilising the region by actions that could imperil regional security,” he said when asked about the maritime security environment in the IOR. He showered praise on China and its role in the IOR repeatedly.  “The PLA Navy has been sending its flotilla to the Gulf of Aden since 2009, which has contributed significantly toward maritime security in Indian Ocean region. “The PLA Navy’s consistent participation in Multinational Exercise AMAN since 2007 and conducting of bilateral exercises have been conducive to the overall maritime security environment in the Indian Ocean region. “The PLA Navy’s presence in the Indian Ocean region is thus an important element in maintaining the regional balance of power and promoting maritime security. ”Niazi went on to outline how valuable the cooperation between the navies of China and Pakistan is as the former continues to equip the latter’s sea forces with latest warships, submarines, and new technologies. “Naval collaboration between the two countries has been strengthened with the procurement of F-22P frigates, fast attack craft (missile), helicopters and state-of-the-art survey ship.  The PN has also contracted construction of eight Hangor-class submarines, four Type 054A/P ships and medium-altitude long-endurance unmanned combat aerial vehicles from China,” the Pakistani navy chief said. Pakistan is also looking to China to enhance its long-range anti-submarine warfare and anti-surface warfare capability through induction of long-range maritime patrol jets, unmanned combat aerial vehicles and modernising our existing fleet with state-of-the-art weapons and surveillance systems, Niazi said. “We are also looking at acquisition of modern helicopters, corvettes and shallow-water attack submarines,” he said. Niazi also spoke on the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor and how the Gwadar port is the initiative’s lynchpin. Cooperating with the Pakistani navy gives China reach across the IOR and the Arabian Sea, close to India’s west coast.  For Pakistan, it’s access to weapons and technology to counter India. “Chinese Navy hosts a number of modern and technologically advanced platforms in their inventory.  Operating with these modern and high-tech platforms affords us an opportunity to refine our tactics and procedures,” Niazi said. “It is heartening to know that the PLA Navy now operates two aircraft carriers.  The PN would like to conduct an exercise with these carriers whenever an opportunity arises.  Moreover, the PLA Navy and PN ships regularly visit each other’s ports.  In the same stride, the PN would continue to welcome further visits by PLA Navy ships, including aircraft carriers,” Niazi said. \",\n  \"document_ocr\": \"KMTC.\\nCOSCO\\n\",\n  \"Category\": \"Insufficient_Text\"\n}, {\n  \"Id\": 34880,\n  \"claim_image\": \"http://pbs.twimg.com/media/D0PAotLW0AIxE0c.jpg?format=jpg&name=large\",\n  \"claim\": \"Hollywood's A-listers brought their A-game to the Oscars red carpet.

Speaking at a media conference in Bengaluru, DK Shivakumar, the new state Congress president, said that they had taken a verbal approval of the police commissioner for the event which was planned for June 14. “Earlier, it had been postponed twice on May 31 and June 7.  We had reserved 7,800 different locations across the state apart from 3,500 other places for Congress workers to participate in the ‘Pratijna Dina’ (oath day).  Despite clearly saying that only 150 people will assemble in the KPCC office itself, permission has been denied.  I am surprised at the vendetta politics unleashed by CM Yediyurappa,” said Shivakumar. The Congress high command had named Shivakumar as the new chief of the Karnataka unit on March 11 after incumbent Dinesh Gundu Rao resigned in December 2019 taking moral responsibility for the poor show in by-elections.  Since then, the Congress has been trying to hold an event for Shivakumar. Pointing out that BJP leaders in the state were participating in events where thousands have participated, Shivakumar questioned why there was no action against them and accused the government of double standards towards the opposition.  “BJP leaders in West Bengal and Bihar were holding mega rallies and is the law different for different political parties? ” Shivakumar said. Underscoring that he would continue to tour the state and meet people, Shivakumar said his party would explore the legal options available to hold the event. \",\n  \"document_ocr\": \"\",\n  \"Category\": \"Insufficient_Text\"\n}, {\n  \"Id\": 34882,\n  \"claim_image\": \"http://pbs.twimg.com/media/D0z_0pcUwAIF8CH.jpg?format=jpg&name=large\",\n  \"claim\": \"Punjab(Pakistan) Minister Fayyaz ul Hassan Chohan: He is alive, Maulana Masood Azhar is alive, we have no information of his death. #Lahore https://t.co/Z3zNWvBjNe\",\n  \"claim_ocr\": \"ANI\\nAN\\n\",\n  \"document_image\": \"http://pbs.twimg.com/media/D0x4ASBUYAA9wwb.jpg?format=jpg&name=large\",\n  \"document\": \"Intelligence agencies were trying to ascertain reports on social media about the death of Jaish-e-Mohammed terror group chief Masood Azhar in Pakistan, officials said on Sunday.

A resident of Bahawalpur in Pakistan’s Punjab province, Azhar formed the Jaish-e-Mohammed in 2000.  The 50-year-old Azhar, who was released by the NDA government in 1999 in exchange of hostages of the hijacked Indian Airlines plane IC-814, has been accused of being the mastermind of the 2001 Parliament attack, suicide attack on Jammu and Kashmir state assembly, attack on Pathankot IAF base and the latest Pulwama terror strike. Social media was filled with reports that Azhar had died, but there was no confirmation as of now, the officials said.

Beachfront condominium collapses in South FloridaAt least three people are dead and 99 others are unaccounted for after a 12-story residential building partially collapsed in southern Florida's Miami-Dade County early Thursday, officials said. The partial collapse of the Champlain Towers South condominium in the small, beachside town of Surfside, about 6 miles north of Miami Beach, was reported around 1:30 a. m.  local time.  The oceanfront complex has 136 units, and approximately 55 of them collapsed along the northeast corridor, according to Miami-Dade Fire Rescue Assistant Chief Raide Jadallah. A massive search and rescue operation was launched before dawn and crews are still carefully combing through the wreckage and remaining structure in hopes of finding survivors.  So far, crews have rescued 35 people who were trapped in the building and two others from beneath the rubble, Jadallah told reporters. A Miami-Dade County official confirmed to ABC News that the death toll was up to three. Teams of firefighters have been cutting through the rubble and placing sonar devices as part of the search efforts, which continued overnight.  Responders have not heard any voices coming from the pile but have picked up \\\"a possibility of a banging,\\\" according to Jadallah. \\\"This process is slow and methodical,\\\" Jadallah said during press conference in Surfside on Thursday afternoon.  \\\"Every time there's a shift in the rubble, we have additional rubble that shifts on us. \\\"Miami-Dade County Mayor Daniella Levine Cava told reporters that 102 people have now been accounted for but at leat 99 others remain missing.  She said search and rescue crews will be \\\"working around the clock. \\\"\\\"As the day comes to an end, their day does not,\\\" Levine Cava said during a press conference in Surfside on Thursday evening. \\\"We need to allow them to do their work because every minute in this search can make a huge difference,\\\" she said at an earlier press conference. Footage from the scene showed firefighters pulling a boy from the rubble alive and rescuing others from still-standing balconies. Jadallah told reporters that at least 11 people were medically assessed and treated on site, four of whom were then transported to local hospitals. Aventura Hospital and Medical Center said it has received three patients from the scene -- two in critical condition and one in fair condition -- while Jackson Health System said it received two patients. A \\\"substantial number\\\" of the condominium's residents are foreigners, according to Florida Sen.  Marco Rubio. Paraguay's foreign ministry said that six Paraguayan nationals were in the building and are still missing: Sophia López-Moreira, the sister of the country's first lady; her husband, Luis Pettengill; their three children; and their nanny, Lady Luna Villalba.  Paraguayan President Mario Abdo Benítez canceled his events due to the incident. Meanwhile, Argentina's consulate in Miami said that nine Argentine nationals are missing.  Venezuela's ambassador to the United States confirmed that four Venezuelan nationals are missing.  Uruguay's foreign ministry said that three Uruguayan nationals have been affected by the incident, though their status was unclear.  Colombia's foreign ministry also reported that six Colombian nationals resided in the condominium and officials were still trying to determine whether they were there at the time of the collapse. Florida resident Soriya Cohen told ABC News that her husband, Brad Cohen, a 51-year-old orthopedic surgeon, and her brother-in-law, Gary Cohen, a doctor visiting from Alabama, both are missing.  Soriya Cohen said they haven't been answering their phones and she does not have hope that they are alive. \\\"Just look at that rubble,\\\" Soriya Cohen told ABC News, pointing at the wreckage. She said she and her daughter were staying in a different home at the time because their family is in the process of moving.  Her son is currently studying abroad and trying to get home, she said. “It’s been surreal,” she added.  “My daughter has been in absolute shock. ”Gabe Nir, who lives in the Champlain Towers South with his mother and sister, told ABC News that they ran from the building when they heard the collapse. Nir said he felt a second, more intense collapse and that they ran for their lives as a thick cloud of white dust enveloped them, making it hard to breathe.  Nir, who compared the collapse to an earthquake, said he's grateful to be alive. Another witness told ABC News that his wife cares for an elderly woman who lives in the condominium and frantically called him around 1:15 a. m.  local time, after the units next door came crashing down.  He said his wife and the elderly woman both were rescued. A Miami-Dade county official told ABC News it's been difficult to determine how many people were in the collapsed section of the building, partly due to the fact that there isn't an on-scene management company that keeps track.  The condominium is a mix of full-time residents, seasonal residents, renters and short-term visitors, so authorities have been relying largely on neighbors and word of mouth. Miami-Dade County has an urban search and rescue team that has been dispatched to earthquakes and other disasters all around the world, but this is the first time that the team has been deployed on home turf, according to the official. The official told ABC News that there's real concern about the structural integrity of the remaining building, particularly from dangling wires and portions of concrete.  Fires have flared up throughout the day, adding to the danger for the search and rescue teams, the official said. The unaffected section of the condominium was cleared as of 8 a. m.  local time.  But due to the lingering dangers, several blocks of the complex will be closed for the next week, according to the official. Surfside Mayor Charles Burkett called the partial collapse a \\\"catastrophe. \\\" He told reporters that the condominium was built in the 1980s and was believed to be substantially full at the time of the partial collapse.  The building was undergoing roof work, he said. Some 15 families escaped the building on their own and were put up in a local hotel, according to Burkett.  Search dogs did an initial pass around the wreckage when it was still dark and the site was considered dangerous, but there were no signs of survivors at that time, the mayor said. Surfside Commissioner Nelly Velasquez told ABC News that the building was up for its 40-year recertification. The Champlain Towers South Condo Association was preparing to start a new construction project to make updates and the condominium had been through extensive inspections, according to Kenneth Direktor, a lawyer for the association.  Direktor said that he hadn't been warned of any structural issues with the building or about the land it was built on.  He said there was water damage to the complex, but that is common for oceanfront properties and wouldn't have caused the collapse. \\\"Nothing like this has ever been seen, at least not in the 40 years I've been doing this,\\\" Direktor told ABC News. Florida Gov.  Ron DeSantis toured the site, telling reporters it was \\\"traumatic to see. \\\"\\\"It's a tragic day,\\\" DeSantis said during a press conference in Surfside on Thursday afternoon.  \\\"We still have hope to be able to identify additional survivors. \\\"The governor declared a state of emergency in Miami-Dade County that evening \\\"to provide assistance for the families impacted by the Surfside tragedy,\\\" according to the order. U. S.  President Joe Biden told reporters that he spoke with the Miami-Dade County mayor as well as U. S.  Rep.  Debbie Wasserman Schultz, who represents the Florida district. Biden said he was waiting on the governor to ask for an emergency declaration, but he is \\\"ready to move from the federal resources immediately, immediately, if in fact we're asked for it. \\\"The cause of the collapse was unknown.  The Miami-Dade Police Department is leading an investigation into the incident. \\\"Our goal is to provide a thorough investigation and closure for our families,\\\" Freddy Ramirez, director of the Miami-Dade Police Department, said during a press conference in Surfside on Thursday morning. Authorities have opened a family assistance center at the Surfside recreational center for individuals unable to locate loved ones who live in the Champlain Towers South.  Anyone with family members from the condominium who are either safe or still missing is urged to call 305-614-1819 to account for them.

Michael Cohen's statement: Trump is 'a racist,' aware of email leaksRep.  Kathleen Rice, D-N. Y. , asked the House Ethics Committee Tuesday to investigate a tweet from a Republican congressman about Michael Cohen ahead of his public testimony before Congress, a move that could prompt an official investigation. In a letter to the panel, Rice said she believes Rep.  Matt Gaetz's controversial tweet Tuesday evening, which implied alleged details about Cohen's romantic life could come out during Cohen’s public testimony, constituted witness tampering. Gaetz, a self-described Trump loyalist, tweeted: “Hey @MichaelCohen212 - Do your wife & father-in-law know about your girlfriends?  Maybe tonight would be a good time for that chat.  I wonder if she’ll remain faithful when you’re in prison.  She’s about to learn a lot. . . ”\\\"As a former District Attorney and federal prosecutor, I believe this statement is in violation of 18 U. S.  Code 1512, which clearly defines witness tampering and intimidation,\\\" she wrote in the letter obtained by ABC News.  \\\"According to the Department of Justice . . .  this statute applies to proceedings before Congress. \\\"Rice, who encouraged the committee to refer the matter to the Justice Department after an investigation, discussed the tweet with Gaetz on the House floor Tuesday evening, according to a source familiar with their conversation. Under its rules, the House ethics panel could launch an investigation into the matter from the referral.  A committee official declined to comment on Rice's referral. After a committee investigation, the panel could eventually recommend the House vote to reprimand, censure or fine Gaetz, Bryson Morgan, a former investigative counsel for the House of Representatives Office of Congressional Ethics, told ABC News. The panel could also recommend expulsion, which would require a two-thirds majority of the chamber. Gaetz was questioned by reporters moments after his tweet and why he wrote it, saying “the tweet speaks for itself. \\\"Gaetz was asked if the tweet should be perceived as a threat telling reporters, “Absolutely not.  We’re witness testing not witness tampering.  And when witnesses come before Congress their truthfulness and voracity ought to be tested and we have the opportunity. ”Gaetz apologized in a later tweet around midnight Wednesday and said he planned to delete the inflammatory Cohen tweet. \\\"Speaker, I want to get the truth too.  While it is important 2 create context around the testimony of liars like Michael Cohen, it was NOT my intent to threaten, as some believe I did,\\\" he said in a response to a tweet from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif.  \\\"I’m deleting the tweet & I should have chosen words that better showed my intent.  I’m sorry. \\\"Lanny J.  Davis, an attorney for Michael Cohen, said: \\\"We will not respond to Mr.  Gaetz’s despicable lies and personal smears, except to say we trust that his colleagues in the House, both Republicans and Democrats, will repudiate his words and his conduct.  I also trust that his constituents will not appreciate that their congressman has set a new low — which in today’s political culture is hard to imagine as possible. ”The tweet from Gaetz was a stunning attack from a member of Congress ahead of public testimony. “I think it’s enough to warrant an investigation.  This is knowingly using intimidation . . .  with the intent to influence or delay or prevent the testimony,” said Melanie Sloan, a former federal prosecutor, senior adviser to American Oversight, a government watchdog group referring to the federal code.  “This guy could be charged with witness tampering. ”Asked for any proof about his allegations against Cohen, Gaetz told ABC News \\\"tune in tomorrow and find out. \\\" Gaetz is not a member of the House Oversight Committee, which will question Cohen tomorrow for his first public hearing. Cohen has been testifying before members and staff of the Senate Intelligence Committee behind closed doors since first thing Tuesday morning. The longtime Trump Organization employee plead guilty to lying to Congress as well as financial crimes including bank and tax fraud late last year.  Cohen also pleaded guilty to campaign finance violation for payments made to adult film star Stormy Daniels during the 2016 presidential campaign. A source familiar with his public testimony plans for Wednesday told ABC News Cohen is expected to publicly accuse President Trump of potentially committing a crime while in office.  The accusation, according to the source, is related to Trump's alleged repayment of money to Cohen for his deal with Daniels.  Trump has denied Daniels' claim but has admitted to the reimbursement. Trump has denied the affair alleged by Daniels and another accusation from former Playboy model Karen McDougal, and has previously said the payment amounted to nothing more than a “simple private transaction,” and that they do not qualify as campaign finance violations.

Trump's lawyers addressed and dismissed reported allegations by Bolton that Trump told him he was withholding military aid to Ukraine until Ukraine agreed to investigate the Bidens. They argued, even if true, that doesn't constitute an impeachable offense. The next phase of the trial -- in which senators will submit questions to both sides for up to 16 hours -- is expected to begin Wednesday.  After that, a pivotal point in the trial -- a Senate vote on whether to consider new witnesses and other evidence -- could come as early as Friday. The ABC News team of correspondents and producers is covering every aspect of this story. Here is how the day unfolded. White House counsel Pat Cippollone ends three days of arguments with a low-key but impassioned plea to senators. \\\"The Senate cannot allow this to happen.  It is time for this to end here and now. ,' he says.  \\\"So, we urge the Senate to reject these articles of impeachment for all the reasons we have given you. \\\"Cipollone tells the senators to end the era of impeachment \\\"for good. \\\"'This should end now, as quickly as possible,\\\" he argues.  \\\"Reject these articles of impeachment for our country and for the American people. \\\"Cipollone spoke after a brief recess. As that recess began, Sen.  Susan Collins turned to her GOP colleague and seat mate Sen.  Lisa Murkowski and both huddled, intensely in their seats - talking just to one another, ABC's Trish Turner reports from the chamber.  Each is resting her head in hand -- as if to shield what is being said from press and potentially GOP colleagues all around them. They are two key senators on the question of witnesses.  Most stopped taking notes during the Sekulow comments. And ABC's Devin Dwyer reports that after Murkowski and Collins broke the Alaska senator stood in the aisle shoulder to shoulder with GOP Whip Sen John Thune for over 10 minutes, both clearly presenting countering views on the question of witnesses. Thune, heavily chewing gum, looked sternly away while Murkowski seemed to thoughtfully lay out her thinking into his left ear.  You could see her saying \\\"witnesses\\\" but exact statements not clear. Murkowski’s body language and facial expressions seemed to reflect the conflicted views she has made publicly in recent days. I can overhear her saying \\\". . . . imagine if it was someone else. . . \\\" and \\\". . .  I do understand the concerns. . . \\\" and \\\". . . .  there’s no way anyone wants that. . . . \\\" She occasionally shrugs her shoulders. Jay Sekulow, one of the president's lead lawyers, takes the Senate floor to sum up the team's arguments, and appears to reference the Bolton manuscript controversy, saying \\\"The trial of the leader of the free world and the duly elected President of the United States is one of the most solemn of duties.  It is not a game of leaks and unsourced manuscripts. \\\"\\\"You cannot impeach a president based on an unsourced allegation,\\\" he says later, this time mentioning Bolton by name and the president's denial of his allegation that he heard him tie withholding Ukraine aid to Ukraine agreeing to an investigation of the Bidens. Sekulow also says all the legal scholars the president's lawyers have presented have warned against lowering the bar for impeachment, saying it would set a bad precedent. \\\"Hamilton put impeachment in the hands of this body, the Senate, precisely and specifically to be above that fray.  This is the greatest deliberative body on Earth.  In our presentation so far, you have now heard from legal scholars from a variety of schools of thought, from a variety of political backgrounds, but they do have a common theme with a dire warning, danger.  Danger.  Danger,\\\" he says. \\\"To lower the bar of impeachment based on these articles of impeachment would impact the functioning of our constitutional republic and the framework of that Constitution for generations,\\\" he continues, attacking Democrats. \\\"The claim that foreign policy decisions can be deemed abuses of power based on subjective opinions about mixed or sole motives that the president was interested only in helping himself demonstrate the dangers of employing the vague, subjective and politically malleable phrase, abuse of power as a constitutionally permissible criteria for the removal of a president,\\\" he says, echoing the argument from Alan Dershowitz on Monday night. . Sekulow connects that idea to The New York Times report of excerpts from Bolton's book that has increased calls for Bolton's testimony.  But Sekulow says that even if those comments are true the president's behavior still isn't an impeachable offense. Senators are paying attention, but only a few appear to be taking notes, ABC's Mary Bruce notes from the Senate gallery. Sen.  Susan Collins is still the most prolific note taker.  And a new name stands out, Bill Cassidy of Louisiana.  He is also paying close attention. Romney is listening and looked slightly unamused during the more political portion of Sekulow's remarks. Before things got underway, Sen.  Liindsey Graham was seen speaking very briefly to Collins and Cassidy, separately. Graham genuinely seems bored.  He is snapping his gum, staring at the wall and constantly leaving the chamber for long stretches. The most activity in the room is happening at the Trump legal team and managers' tables. From my vantage point, I could see directly over Sekulow's shoulder as he tweaked and rewrote the top of his remarks.  Notable, since the beginning of his comments included a not-so-subtle reference to Bolton's allegations, saying \\\"It's not a game of leaks and unsourced manuscripts. \\\"The managers did not make eye contact when Sekulow ripped into their handling of the House impeachment process.  But Schiff is taking non-stop notes.  And there was a lot of chatter among members of the team throughout the presentations. I think it’s fair to say no one here really yet knows the outcome of the question of whether or not to call witnesses, ABC's Trish Turner says in analysis. There’s a blizzard of spin and pressure being brought to bear against GOP senators. White House Legislative Affairs Director Eric Ueland has been making the rounds pressing GOP senators to oppose the vote on calling witnesses, according to 2 GOP senators requesting anonymity who were contacted by Ueland. One senior administration official tells ABC the case is basically this:\\\"This could add weeks if not months to a potential trial process and lead to some very challenging outcomes for the Senate as an institution, the court itself, and obviously how it would handle executive privilege issues out in the executive branch and in Congress. So, for example, is there supposed to be one set of rules for executive privilege and classified information for Senate presidential impeachment trials only and one set of rules for everything else?  There are some real practical challenges that start to crop up pretty quickly. \\\"The source noted there are real-time implications and concerns about executive privilege assertions.  You could see a situation, the source says, where \\\"every question that rotates around executive privilege having to go to a court for adjudication – every one of those questions is a time process.  This is a question by question affirmation of executive privilege which is held by the president, not by Ambassador Bolton. \\\"There’s also a challenge \\\"about the availability of information. \\\"As for releasing the Bolton manuscript in a classified setting, the official said \\\"Lots of people have talked about this, but there are lots of attendant complexities. \\\"Who owns the manuscript?  The publisher?  Is it Bolton’s?  The marketer’s?   The administration official said this might not be a White House or Senate question to be answered.  This source said the White House has \\\"little visibility\\\" into this. Some of the concern is abated by addressing this in a classified setting but to put it mildly, the administration wouldn’t trust that the information would stay classified. The document could also still be subject to privilege assertions. That’s why they handled it very carefully on the Senate floor, versus the speculation in the media. There are \\\"complex and somewhat novel legal issues suddenly front and senator courtesy of the article,\\\" the official said. Where is the Trump administration on the witness vote?  \\\"No predictions,\\\" the official said. Tuesday's trial session gets underway with White House deputy counsel Patrick Philbin saying he wants to elaborate on arguments made last night by former Harvard Law School professor Alan Dershowitz.  He argued that a president cannot be impeached for \\\"abuse of power\\\" and \\\"obstruction of Congress\\\" because the language is too vague -- that the Constitution requires a crime or something like a crime. Philbin also asks, \\\"How do we tell what an illicit motive is?  How do we get inside the president's head? \\\" regarding what he says are Trump's lawful actions on their face. Philbin specifically says there was no malicious intent in the decision to move the rough transcript of the July 25 call between Presidents Trump and Zelenskiy to a more highly restricted server, citing testimony from witnesses that they did not believe that was done to hide any perceived wrongdoing in the call.  He plays testimony from U. S.  Army Lt.  Col.  Alexander Vindman and National Security Council official Tim Morrison. \\\"So, why we're even here talking about these accusations about a cover-up when it's a transcript that was preserved and made public is somewhat absurd? \\\" Philbin says. He also countered Democrats' argument that the whistleblower complaint that first raised concerns about the call and the administration's dealings with Ukraine should have been provided immediately to Congress once it was deemed to be a matter of \\\"urgent concern. \\\"Philbin argues the law doesn't say if the matter is urgent it has to be shared immediately, but specifically defines \\\"urgent concern\\\" as a serious or flagrant problem, violation of law as it relates to funding, or interference in intelligence matters.  He said the Office of Legal Counsel at the Justice Department looked at the complaint and determined it did not meet the definition of \\\"urgent concern. \\\"\\\"Remember what we're talking about here is a head of state communication between the president of the United States and another head of state.  This isn't some CIA operation overseas.  This isn't the NSA doing something.  This isn't any intelligence activity going on within the intelligence community under the supervision of the DNI.  It's the head of the executive branch exercising his constitutional authority, engaging with foreign relations with a foreign head of state,\\\" he says. GOP moderate Sen.  Lisa Murkowski of Alaska is signaling that she is increasingly likely to support hearing from John Bolton.  Asked if she wants to read his manuscript, she says, \\\"I think that Bolton probably has something to offer us.  So we’ll figure out how we’re going to learn more,\\\" she said, before hopping into an elevator. --ABC News Mariam KhanGOP Sen.  James Lankford, who late Monday floated the idea of reviewing Bolton’s manuscript, tells CNN the review is necessary before senators can decide whether to call him as a witness. \\\"This at least allows people to reach a decision based on facts that they can actually read in the manuscript,\\\" Lankford says. The National Security Council, which is based at the White House, has held Bolton’s manuscript since he submitted it for a standard review process last month, according to a Bolton representative and an NSC spokesperson. Sen.  Mitt Romney, one of the key moderates Democrats hope will support new testimony, again appears open to new testimony.  But he goes further on Tuesday, suggesting he’s just as open to hearing from other witnesses called by Trump’s defense team. \\\"I'd like to hear from John Bolton and I think the idea that's been expressed in the media about having each side be able to choose a witness or maybe more than one witness on a paired basis, it has some merit,\\\" Romney tells reporters. Some Republicans and Democrats have reportedly considered calling former Vice President Joe Biden to the Senate floor in exchange for senior officials with closer connections to the President. But Democratic senators have publicly rejected the idea, insisting the accusations that the Bidens engaged in Ukraine-related corruption are baseless distractions. --ABC News' Sarah KolinovskySenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer makes another argument for witnesses before Trump's impeachment trial convenes at 1 p. m. He notes that with the president's denial of John Bolton's allegation on Monday, the two are telling opposing stories and says, since Trump won't testify, senators need to hear from Bolton to decide who's telling the truth. He says it's \\\"on the shoulders of four Republican senators\\\" to make sure Bolton, acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney and two other administration officials testify, referring to GOP Sens.  Mitt Romney, Susan Collins, Lisa Murkowski and Lamar Alexander. He also called the GOP talk of having senators read the Bolton manuscript in a secure setting is an \\\"absurd proposal. \\\"\\\"Nothing is a substitute for a witness testifying under oath,\\\" Schumer says. \\\"We're not bargaining with them,\\\" Schumer says of Republican talk of having Hunter Biden testify in exchange for Bolton appearing. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events\",\n  \"document_ocr\": \"abc NEWS LIVE\\nanimo\\n\",\n  \"Category\": \"Insufficient_Text\"\n}, {\n  \"Id\": 34891,\n  \"claim_image\": \"http://pbs.twimg.com/media/D0fer78WsAAZcTI.jpg?format=jpg&name=large\",\n  \"claim\": \"CNN's @DonLemon: \\\"You cannot care about one lie or liar and then dismiss another.

What we learned from Michael Cohen's House Oversight Committee testimonyMichael Cohen, President Donald Trump's former lawyer and fixer, testifed publicly for the first time Wednesday about his experience in the Trump orbit before the House Oversight Committee, painting a harsh portrait of the president as an unscrupulous businessman who may have committed a crime while in office. Cohen also repeated what he said in a copy of his prepared remarks obtained by ABC News, claiming that Trump, as a candidate, knew his longtime confidant Roger Stone was talking with Julian Assange about WikiLeaks' possibly revealing emails hacked from the Democratic National Committee. In a statement to ABC News on Wednesday morning, Stone denied Cohen's allegation.  Julian Assange attorney Barry Pollack, in a statement, said, “Roger Stone did not have the telephone call Michael Cohen described. \\\"Here is how the hearing unfolded:5:20 p. m.  – Committee chairman in closing remarks: ‘We are better than this’In a fiery and impassioned speech to close out Wednesday’s blockbuster hearing after more than seven hours, Rep.  Elijah Cummings, D-Md. , called on members of his committee to “be better” as he sympathized with Cohen’s position. “We are better than this.  We are so much—we really are.  We are so much better than this,” Cummings said, adding, “when we are dancing with the angels, the question will be asked: in 2019 what did we do? ”Cummings’ sentiment drew an emotional response from Cohen, who appeared to be holding back tears when the chairman invoked the harm Cohen’s actions has caused his family. When he finished, Cummings pounded his gavel and adjourned the hearing more than seven hours after gaveling it in. 5:05 p. m.  – Cohen: If Trump loses 2020 election, 'I fear' there won’t be a peaceful transition of powerIn a dramatic statement at the conclusion of Wednesday’s hearing, Michael Cohen made a startling prediction: If President Trump fails to win a reelection bid in 2020, he may not give up his grip on power. “Given my experience working for President Trump, I fear that if he loses the election in 2020 that there will never be a peaceful transition of power,” Cohen said.  “This is why I agreed to appear before you today. ”Cohen then called on President Trump to cease attacks on the media, Gold Star families, and others. “You don't vilify people based on the god they pray to and you don't cuddle up to our adversaries at the expense of our allies,” Cohen said.  “You don't shut down to appease your base.  This behavior the office of the president and it simply is un-American. ”4:55 p. m.  – Democrat accuses GOP committee member of 'racist act'Rep.  Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich. , accused a Republican colleague of using a “black woman as a prop” during Wednesday’s testimony, sparking uproar from Republicans on the committee and calls for her comments to be stricken from the record. Tlaib’s statement came in response to Rep.  Mark Meadows, R-N. C. , inviting Lynne Patton, a current Department of Housing and Urban Development official and former longtime Trump Organization employee, to Wednesday’s hearing.  Meadows asked to include Patton’s statement defending Trump against accusations that he is “a racist” into the record.  Patton is a black woman. Meadows took issue with Tlaib’s remarks, offering an emotional rebuttal and defending his record of advocating civil rights for racial minorities. Tlaib clarified that she does not believe Meadows is a racist but accused him of “a racist act. ”4:45 p. m.  – Rep.  Ocasio-Cortez questions Cohen over Trump golf coursesIn a line of questioning by Rep.  Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N. Y. , Michael Cohen described how he said Donald Trump sought to garner tax deductions by reducing the value of his golf properties. Asked how the president did so, Cohen said, “you deflate the value of the asset and put in a request to the tax department for a deduction. ”Rep.  Ocasio-Cortez cited a lengthy New York Times article published in October describing “dubious tax schemes” Trump engaged in during the 1990s. 4:27 p. m.  – Hearing resumes after lengthy recessAfter a nearly two hour break -- an hour longer than stated -- members of the committee and Michael Cohen have returned to their seats for the final leg of questioning.  Overall, Cohen seems to have fended off most Republican attacks on him so far by taking a non-combative approach and repeatedly asserting that while he's lied previously, he's telling the truth now. 2:30 p. m.  – Stormy Daniels weighs in: ‘Michael, I’m proud of you’Shortly before the committee took what was expected to about an hour break for lunch, the adult film actress at the heart of president’s hush money payments controversy released a statement during Cohen’s testimony, saying she’s “proud” of Cohen for “finally beginning to tell the truth about what you did. ”Stormy Daniels, whose name has been repeatedly invoked over the course of Wednesday’s hearing for her role as the recipient of a hush money payment, appeared moved by Cohen’s testimony. “I can hear the pain and regret you feel for betraying your family and your country,” she said.  “Thank you for having the courage, at long last, to begin to tell the truth. ”Cohen executed the $130,000 payment to Daniels prior to the 2016 election.  President Trump has denied having an affair with Daniels. 2:10 p. m.  – Cohen describes plans to have Trump visit Russia during campaignMichael Cohen described negotiations he said he conducted with Trump campaign manager Cory Lewandowski “early on in the campaign” to have Trump visit Russia to “take a look” at the Trump Tower in Moscow project. Cohen and Lewandowski discussed the “possibility of which dates that Mr.  Trump would have availability if, in fact, that we were going to go over to Russia to take a look at the project. ”In November, Cohen pleaded guilty to lying to Congress about whether Trump and his company had pursued the Moscow real estate project while Trump was securing the GOP nomination in 2016. Cohen said the visit “never came to fruition because we were never successful in getting … ownership or control over a piece of property. ”1:45 p. m.  – Cohen contradicts Steele dossier, says he has never been to PragueMichael Cohen insisted under oath on Wednesday that he has never been to Prague or the Czech Republic, a central allegation in the dossier former MI-6 agent Christopher Steele compiled as opposition research. The dossier describes an incident in August 2016 in which Cohen allegedly traveled to Prague to meet with Russians.  Buzzfeed News posted the dossier in January 2017. Cohen has denied this claim in the past, including during an interview with ABC News. “I’ve never actually walked the land in Prague,” Cohen told ABC News.  “And last August I was not in Prague. ”1:25 p. m.  – Cohen says Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner’s attorney ‘reviewed’ his letter to Congress, tooAbbe Lowell, the attorney who represents the president's daughter and son-in-law, Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner, also reviewed Michael Cohen’s letter to Congress in 2017 that ultimately became the basis for charges Cohen lied to Congress, Cohen said Wednesday. They were not immediately available for comment. Cohen said earlier that Jay Sekulow, one of President Trump’s lawyers, made changes and additions to Cohen's statement, and mentioned that others may have, too. Late Wednesday afternoon, Sekulow issued a statement saying, “Today’s testimony by Michael Cohen that attorneys for the President edited or changed his statement to Congress to alter the duration of the Trump Tower Moscow negotiations is completely false. \\\"In his opening statement on Wednesday, Cohen said one of “Mr.  Trump’s personal lawyers reviewed and edited my statement to Congress about the timing of the Moscow Tower negotiations before I gave it. ”Cohen pleaded guilty in November to lying to Congress about whether Trump and his company had pursued the Moscow real estate project while Trump was securing the GOP nomination in 2016. 1:20 p. m.  – Cohen says Trump called him to coordinate messaging -- effectively lie -- about whether he knew about hush money paymentsMichael Cohen said during testimony on Wednesday that President Trump sought to coordinate public messaging about hush money payments to Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal in February 2018.  The women claim to have had affairs with Trump that he has denied. Trump instructed Cohen to say “he was not knowledgeable of the reimbursements and he wasn't knowledgeable of my actions,” Cohen said, referring to the hush money payments. Trump publicly denied knowledge of the payments before his attorney, Rudy Giuliani, confirmed later – in May 2018 – that Trump reimbursed Cohen for the $130,000 payment to Daniels. 1:00 p. m.  – Cohen says Trump lawyer Jay Sekulow made changes to his false statement to CongressMichael Cohen said one of President Trump’s lawyers, Jay Sekulow, made changes and additions to Cohen's statement to Congress in 2017 that ultimately became the basis for charges Cohen lied to Congress. In his opening statement on Wednesday, Cohen said one of “Mr.  Trump’s personal lawyers reviewed and edited my statement to Congress about the timing of the Moscow Tower negotiations before I gave it. ”He later identified that lawyer as Sekulow, who he said made “several changes … including how we were going to handle that message which was … the message, of course, being the length of time that the Trump Tower Moscow project stayed and remained alive. ”Sekulow has not addressed Cohen's claim. Cohen pleaded guilty in November to lying to Congress about whether Trump and his company had pursued the Moscow real estate project while Trump was securing the GOP nomination in 2016. 12:40 p. m.  – Cohen: Aware of another 'illegal act' Trump has committed, says SDNY investigatingMichael Cohen teased another “wrongdoing or illegal act” he claimed President Trump has committed, but said he could not give details because of an ongoing investigation headed by federal prosecutors in the Southern District of New York. Asked by Rep.  Raja Krishnamoorthi, D-Ill. , whether there is “any other wrongdoing or illegal act that you are aware of regarding Donald Trump that we haven't yet discussed today,” Cohen replied he was aware. “Yes,” he said, “and again, those are part of the investigation that's currently being looked at by the Southern District of New York. ”Cohen added that he is in “constant contact with the Southern District of New York regarding ongoing investigations. ”Outside the hearing room, SDNY had no comment. 12:30 p. m.  – Cohen to GOP: ‘Not one question so far has been about Mr.  Trump’In response to questions from Rep.  Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, Cohen called out Republicans on the panel for asking only about him and not President Trump. “I just find it interesting, sir, that between yourself and your colleagues, not one question so far since I'm here has been asked about President Trump,” Cohen said.  “That's actually why I thought I was coming today – not to confess the mistakes that I've made.  I've already done that. “The American people don't care about my taxes,” Cohen said.  “They want to know what it is that I know about Mr.  Trump, and not one question so far has been asked about Mr.  Trump. \\\"12:10 p. m.  – Cohen describes 'several factors' that led him to turn on TrumpAsked what caused him to turn on his longtime boss and effectively testify against him, Michael Cohen dramatically ticked off a list of Trump's actions and statements that led him to speak out. “Helsinki, Charlottesville, watching the daily destruction of our civility to one another, putting up with silly things like this,” Cohen said.  “It’s really unbecoming of Congress. ”Cohen said he used to protect Trump the way Republican members of the House Oversight Committee are protecting the president at Wednesday’s hearing. “I'm responsible for your silliness because I did the same thing that you're doing now for ten years,” Cohen said.  “I protected Mr.  Trump for ten years … I can only warn people the more people that follow Mr.  Trump, as I did blindly, are going to suffer the same consequences that I'm suffering. ”12:02 p. m.  – Cohen rejects accusation he’s trying to get a reduction in sentenceMichael Cohen denied a claim that his appearance is part of an effort to earn a reduction in his prison sentence. Asked by Rep.  Paul Gosar, R-Ariz. , whether his testimony could result in a reduction in his three-year sentence, Cohen said “it’s a possibility,” but rejected the notion that it is his purpose for testifying publicly before the House Oversight Committee. “I'm not sure how my appearance here today is providing substantial information that the Southern District can use for the creation of a case,” Cohen said, before joking, “Now if there is something that this group can do for me, I would gladly welcome it. ”Cohen is scheduled to report to prison on May 6. 12:00 p. m.  – Cohen describes Trump’s involvement in Trump Tower Moscow projectShortly before Michael Cohen asked for a break, he described what he said was the extent of Trump’s involvement in the Trump Tower Moscow negotiations during the campaign. “After each communication that I had [about the Trump Tower Moscow project], I would report back to [Trump] and our goal was to get this project,” Cohen said.  “We were interested in building what would have been the largest building in all of Europe. ”In his opening statement, Cohen said Trump remained directly involved in negotiations and often asked Cohen, “How’s it going in Russia? ”In November, Cohen pleaded guilty to lying to Congress about whether Trump and his company had pursued a Moscow real estate project while he was securing the GOP nomination in 2016. 11:45 a. m.  – Cohen pressed on his claim Trump is 'a racist'Rep.  Mark Meadows, R-N. C. , invited a guest to appear during his questioning of Cohen. Lynne Patton, a current Department of Housing and Urban Development official and former longtime Trump Organization employee, stood behind Meadows as he questioned Cohen about his allegation that Trump is “a racist. ”Meadows put a statement from Patton defending Trump into the record and asked Cohen to reconcile his claim with her defense of Trump as an African-American woman and the daughter of a man who grew up in Birmingham, Alabama. Cohen shot back by pointing out that he stands by his testimony as the son of a Holocaust survivor, prompting audible \\\"oohs\\\" from onlookers inside the hearing room. 11:30 a. m.  – Cohen hits back: 'Shame on you, Mr.  Jordan'Cohen, who once called himself Donald Trump’s “attack dog,” unleashed a heated rebuke of the ranking Republican on the committee, Rep.  Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, during a debate over whether Cohen accepted his guilt. Jordan read a quote the December indictment of Cohen written by federal prosecutors in the Southern District of New York.  It said Cohen’s “consciousness of wrongdoing is fleeting, his instinct to blame others is strong,” and accused Cohen of failing to appropriately show remorse for his actions. Cohen took issue with that characterization. “Shame on you, Mr.  Jordan,” Cohen said.  “That's not what I said.  What I said is, I took responsibility and I take responsibility … I am remorseful and I am going to prison. \\\"Cohen is scheduled to report to prison on May 6 to serve a three-year sentence. 11:12 a. m.  – Cohen says Trump and his children were ‘compromised’ by RussiaDuring a line of questioning about WikiLeaks’ release of internal Democrat National Committee and Hillary Clinton campaign emails, Cohen said he believes President Trump and his children may have been “conflicted or compromised” by Russia during the 2016 presidential campaign. He stopped short of characterizing the campaign’s alleged knowledge of the impending release of hacked Democrats’ emails as “collusion,” but said there was “something odd. ”\\\"As I stated in my testimony, I wouldn't use the word colluding,\\\" Cohen said.  Was there something odd about the back and forth praise with President Putin?  Yes.  But I'm not really sure that I can answer that question in terms of collusion. \\\"In his opening statement, Cohen claimed that Trump, as a candidate, knew his longtime political confidant Roger Stone was talking with Julian Assange about WikiLeaks' revealing of emails from prominent Democrats. 11:05 a. m.  – Cohen denies any desire to work in the White HouseRep.  Jim Jordan of Ohio, the ranking Republican on the committee and first to question Cohen, accused Cohen of acting in defiance of President Trump because he was upset at not getting a position in the White House after Trump’s election. Cohen categorically denied the allegation. “Mr.  Jordan, all I wanted was what I got, to be personal attorney to the president,” Cohen said. Cohen described an incident in which Trump \\\"reamed out\\\" former White House chief of staff Reince Priebus because Cohen hadn't gotten a job in the White House Counsel's office. 10:55 a. m.  – Questioning begins with an inquiry into hush money paymentsAfter Cohen’s 30-minute opening statement, the questioning portion of Wednesday’s hearing is underway. Rep.  Cummings, as committee chairman, began with a line of questioning about the hush money payments Cohen made to adult film actress Stormy Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, and his reimbursement by Trump. “The president said he knew nothing of these favors,” Cummings said.  “Based on your conversations with him, is there any doubt in your mind that President Trump knew exactly what he was paying for? ”“There is no doubt in my mind and I truly believe there is no doubt in the people of the United States of America,” Cohen said. Cohen presented a copy of a check Trump allegedly wrote, after taking office, to reimburse Cohen for the hush-money payment. Outside the hearing room, the Trump Organization responded that Donald Trump Jr.  had \\\"no concept/idea\\\" that he was signing a check to reimburse Cohen for the Stormy Daniels hush money payment.  Donald Trump Jr.  signed the $35,000 check as a trustee of the Donald J.  Trump Revocable Trust. President Trump has denied having an affair with Daniels. 10:42 a. m.  – Michael Cohen shares regrets, shame for a decade of work for Trump“And yet I continued working for him. ”That’s the refrain Michael Cohen is repeating after each damning anecdote he offers about President Trump.  Cohen’s opening statement included repeated mentions of how \\\"ashamed\\\" he feels now about his work for Trump. “I am ashamed because I know what Mr.  Trump is,” Cohen said. Cohen described with remorse the threatening letters he wrote on Trump’s behalf and the bidding he did for a man he called “a racist,” “a conman,” and “a cheat. ”“I am not a perfect man,” Cohen said.  “I have done things I am not proud of, and I will live with the consequences of my actions for the rest of my life. ”10:30 a. m.  – Cohen paints damning picture of Trump in opening statementMichael Cohen tore into President Trump’s character and business acumen in a scathing opening statement, calling him \\\"a racist,\\\" \\\"a con man\\\" and \\\"a cheat. \\\"ABC News reported details of Cohen’s intended testimony earlier on Wednesday. Cohen divulged that Trump, as a candidate, knew Roger Stone was talking with Julian Assange about WikiLeaks' revealing of emails from the Democratic National Committee. 10:25 a. m.  – Cohen sworn in, gives opening statementMichael Cohen began his opening statement after rising, raising his right hand, and being sworn in. \\\"Chairman Cummings, Ranking Member Jordan, and Members of the Committee, thank you for inviting me here today,” Cohen said.  “I am here under oath to correct the record, to answer the Committee’s questions truthfully, and to offer the American people what I know about President Trump. ”10:18 a. m.  – Ranking Republican slams Cohen, Democrats in opening statementThe ranking Republican on the Oversight Committee launched an early attack on Michael Cohen’s credibility and Democrats’ willingness to hear the former fixer’s testimony on Wednesday. “The first announced witness for the 116th Congress is a guy who is going to prison in two months for lying to Congress,” Rep.  Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, said in his opening comments. Jordan criticized Cummings for offering “a convicted felon a forum to tell stories and lie about the president of the United States so they can all start their impeachment process. ”“They just want to use you, Mr.  Cohen,” Jordan said.  “You're their patsy today. ”10:12 a. m.  – Chairman Rep.  Cummings warns Cohen not to lieIn his opening statement, the committee’s chairman, Rep.  Elijah Cummings, warned Cohen against lying to his panel. “I have made it abundantly clear to Mr.  Cohen that if he comes here today and he does not tell us the truth, I will be the first one to refer those untruthful statements to DOJ (the Department of Justice),” Cummings said. Cohen pleaded guilty to lying to Congress in December – charges brought by special counsel Robert Mueller. Cummings added that its hearing today and moving forward reflect a new era of Democratic oversight. “The days of this committee protecting the president at all costs are over,” he said. 10:07 a. m.  – Republicans move to postpone Cohen’s hearingA top Republican leveled an early effort to stop Cohen’s testimony, demanding the hearing be delayed. Rep.  Mark Meadows, R-N. C. , raised a procedural tactic to delay the hearing, citing the short notice of the committee’s receipt of Cohen’s testimony and evidence he plans to present. The committee voted down Rep.  Meadows’ point of order and the hearing continued. 10 a. m.  Cohen takes witness chair, hearing beginsMichael Cohen entered the committee at 10 a. m on the dot and took the witness chair for what promised to be dramatic testimony about his former boss Donald Trump before the House Oversight Committee.  The panel's chairman, Rep.  Elijah Cummings, D-Md. , gaveled in the hearing shortly thereafter. The man who once said he would take a bullet for Donald Trump is poised to excoriate his longtime former boss with more than a decade of anecdotes. In his opening statement, Cohen is expected to characterize Trump as a “racist” and a “conman. ”9:55 a. m.  Committee members gathering inside hearing roomMembers of the House Oversight Committee are gathering in the committee’s hearing room with just minutes until Michael Cohen is expected to take his seat. Democrats met this morning in committee chambers before congregating in the hearing room.  Republicans on the panel have set up large posters with Cohen’s past comments flattering the president. Cohen had no comment as he arrived on Capitol Hill.  As he left his hotel Wednesday morning, staff and hotel guests greeted and wished him well, some hugging him and people saying “God bless you. ”“I’m going to do the right thing,” Cohen said.  He also called it “the craziest day” of his life. Cohen, who spent a decade at Trump's side at the Trump Organization, will testify before House lawmakers at 10 a. m.  Wednesday as President Trump wraps up his first day of meetings with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Vietnam. Cohen is scheduled to begin a three-year prison sentence in May and has pleaded guilty to lying to Congress as well as financial crimes including bank and tax fraud.  Cohen also pleaded guilty to campaign finance violation for payments made to adult film star Stormy Daniels during the 2016 presidential campaign. The White House, along with Republicans on Capitol Hill, sought to discredit Cohen ahead of his appearance. \\\"Disgraced felon Michael Cohen is going to prison for lying to Congress and making other false statements,\\\" White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said Tuesday in a statement.  \\\"Sadly, he will go before Congress this week and we can expect more of the same.  It's laughable that anyone would take a convicted liar like Cohen at his word, and pathetic to see him given yet another opportunity to spread his lies. \\\"Rep.  Matt Gaetz, R-Fla. , a staunch Trump ally, also tweeted Tuesday that the hearing could reveal alleged details about Cohen's romantic life, prompting outrage from Democrats and ethics experts. The stakes were also high for Democrats in the House, who have vowed to investigate the president and conduct oversight of the administration amid accusations of overreach from Republicans. House Oversight Committee Chairman Elijah Cummings, D-Md. , suggested the hearing \\\"may very well be a turning point in our country's history. \\\"\\\"He's the only person that I know of who has accused this president of a crime,\\\" he told reporters on Monday. Cohen was prepared to provide lawmakers with documents to support his claims that Trump allegedly inflated and deflated his net worth for personal and professional gain, and to avoid paying property taxes, according to a source familiar with his intended testimony. The president's former fixer was also expected to explain why he lied to Congress in 2017 about discussions he had during the presidential campaign about the proposed Trump Tower Moscow. His specific allegation of criminal wrongdoing relates to Trump's reimbursement to Cohen for the payment to adult film actress and director Stormy Daniels, who alleged an affair with Trump, according to the source familiar with Cohen's planned testimony. Trump has denied the affair alleged by Daniels and another accusation from former Playboy model Karen McDougal and has previously said the payment amounted to nothing more than a \\\"simple private transaction,\\\" and that they do not qualify as campaign finance violations. Cohen appeared before the House Oversight and Reform Committee after postponing an initial hearing date, citing \\\"threats\\\" to his family by Trump and his lawyer Rudy Giuliani. On Tuesday he spent hours behind closed doors with the Senate Intelligence Committee and will meet with the House Intelligence Committee in private on Thursday. \\\"Two years ago when this investigation started, I said it may be the most important thing I'm involved in my public life in the Senate,\\\" Sen.  Mark Warner, D-Va. , the top Democrat on the panel, told reporters after the panel questioned Cohen.  \\\"Nothing I have heard today dissuades me from that view. \\\"\\\"We will call out the Democrats' charade for what it is -- a partisan circus meant to destroy President Trump,\\\" Reps.  Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, and Mark Meadows, R-N. C. , said in a USA Today editorial. At Cohen's sentencing hearing in December, special counsel Robert Mueller's team said Cohen had cooperated with their investigation. Ahead of the House hearing, during his day with the Senate Intelligence Committee, Cohen was officially disbarred as a lawyer in New York, according to a decision from the Appellate Division of the New York State Supreme Court expected after his November guilty plea.

'Alleged synagogue gunman linked to mosque fireAt the age of 8, Noya Dahan has already fled rocket attacks in Israel, witnessed her home in California vandalized with anti-Semitic graffiti and, now, she's survived a shooting at her synagogue that left one beloved member dead and she, her rabbi and her uncle with bullet wounds. The youngest victim of Saturday's shooting at the Chabad of Poway synagogue near San Diego, Noya told ABC News that the safety of the one place she used to feel secure in, a synagogue, has been shattered. \\\"I never thought that was going to happen to me because like it's a safe place, you're supposed to feel safe,\\\" she said. A day after an alleged 19-year-old gunman, identified by police as John Earnest, opened fire inside the synagogue, turning a Passover service into what Noya's father described as \\\"like a war,\\\" survivors spoke out, offering details on the bullets, blood and chaos they witnessed in the latest gun rampage in America. Noya was hit in the face, near her right cheek and in her right leg by bullet fragments during the attack.  She said she will never forget how loud the gunshots were or seeing her rabbi, Yisroel Goldstein, bleeding profusely from both hands after being shot by the gunman. \\\"I saw the rabbi jumping like crazy, and I couldn't even imagine. . . ,\\\" Noya said.  \\\"I felt like I was in a movie or in a dream or something. \\\"Rabbi Goldstein, who founded the synagogue 33 years ago with his wife, said he was just getting prepared to deliver his Passover sermon at about 11:30 a. m.  when he went out into the lobby and ran into one of the temple's members, Lori Kaye, 60. I was centimeters from death\\\"She's been a member with us since the '90s.  She's one of the most kindest persons, an activist, who's always there to help others, to help the world.  That was her mission in life, just to be out, to do kindness and goodness,\\\" Goldstein told ABC News on Sunday. He said Kaye was at the service with her husband, Dr.  Howard Kaye, and their 22-year-old daughter, Hannah. \\\"She asked me what time Yizkor was,\\\" he said of a special pray for the departed.  \\\"Her mother just recently died and she came to memorialize her. \\\"He said he went to his office to freshen up, and when he came back Kaye had confirmed on her own the time for the Yizkor prayer service. \\\"We both looked and smiled at each other,\\\" the rabbi said.  \\\"I turned around to walk into the banquet hall, where I was going to wash my hands, and I heard the first loud noise. \\\"At first he didn't know if Kaye had fallen or if a table had toppled over. \\\"I turned around and I see the shooter standing there in position with a rifle moving it towards me,\\\" Goldstein said. He said he put both his hands in front of his face in an effort to protect himself.  A bullet severed the index finger of his right hand, and another nearly did the same to his left index finger, he said. He saw Kaye, mortally wounded, lying on the floor.  Bullets continued to fly by on either side of him, he said. \\\"I was centimeters from death,\\\" Goldstein said.  \\\"I turn my back towards him and he's shooting bullets towards me, trying to get me down in the banquet hall. \\\"He said he saw a group of children in the banquet hall, including his grandchildren and Noya and he immediately began to gather them up to get them out of harm's way. Noya's uncle, Almog Peretz, 34, who lives in Israel but is in California on vacation, told ABC News that he was walking from the banquet hall when he heard the shots and saw the gunman. \\\"I turn around and I saw him and the gun, the big gun.  He looks at me and he shoots one after one,\\\" he said. He said he picked up a 5-year-old girl walking next to him, lifted another child in his arms and began to direct up to 20 children out a side door, directing them to the rabbi's house next door. He said he didn't realize he had been shot in the back of the right leg until a relative noticed that the back of his pant leg was full of blood. His brother-in-law, Noya's father, Israel Dahan, said he was frantically searching for his three children.  He said he initially feared one of his girls who had been in the restroom was dead and sent his brother-in-law in to find her. Israel Dahan, who moved his family to California to get away from the danger of rocket attacks on their former home in Israel, said his daughter was frantic, but alive. Rabbi Goldstein, who received a phone call from President Donald Trump while speaking with ABC News, said a U. S.  Border Patrol agent named Jonathan, who had become a member of his congregation and another member named Oscar Stewart, a former military soldier, confronted the gunman. \\\"One of the miracles that happened here was that the rifle got jammed,\\\" he said of the gunman's weapon. He said Oscar and Jonathan chased the gunman out of the synagogue.  He said Jonathan, the Border Patrol agent, picked up a gun apparently dropped by another member of the congregation, and fired at the suspect, hitting his car as he drove off. A police K-9 officer saw the gunman nearby, officials said.  The suspect jumped out of his car, put his hands up and was arrested, San Diego Police Chief David Nisleit said during the conference on Saturday. I really don't feel safe because this is not the first and definitely not the last time this is going to happenRabbi Goldstein said that once the shooter fled the synagogue he went back inside and saw Lori Kaye lying unconscious on the floor.  He said her husband entered the lobby and fainted. Initially refusing medical attention, Goldstein, his bleeding hands wrapped in a pray cloth, addressed his terrified flock. \\\"I saw the sight of fear, of anger and despair on my fellow Jews. . . , I got up on the chair and I said, 'Guys, Am Yisrael Chai,'\\\" he said reciting the Hebrew phrase for 'the people of Israel live. '\\\"'We are alive,'\\\" he said he told the worshipers.  \\\"'We need to stand tall.  We need to be proud of our heritage and do not allow any of this terrorism to tear us down. \\\"Since the shooting, he has asked himself why he survived. \\\"What do I do with this?  What do I do with my survival?  I think there is a message that I need to share with everyone,\\\" he said.  \\\"And we've got to get the message out there: People need to be aware that anti-Semitism is a reality.  It's happening now just like it was happening prior to the holocaust.  This is how the holocaust started and we have to get up and stop it. \\\"For young Noya, whose home was vandalized with anti-Semitic graffiti four years ago, life has changed forever. \\\"I just kept on dreaming about it.  I just couldn't . . .  dream about something good.  I just dreamt about the bad things,\\\" she told ABC News.  \\\"I really don't feel safe because this is not the first and definitely not the last time this is going to happen.  So now I know just to watch out and stuff for dangerous things to happen. \\\"24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events\",\n  \"document_ocr\": \"\",\n  \"Category\": \"Insufficient_Text\"\n}, {\n  \"Id\": 34893,\n  \"claim_image\": \"http://pbs.twimg.com/amplify_video_thumb/1099923660989779969/img/T-kugbL0n2_8B6hO.jpg?format=jpg&name=large\",\n  \"claim\": \"\\\"As artists, our job is to look where others don't.\\\" Alfonso Cuarón took home Best Director for 'Roma.' https://t.co/9cLUC3vxk2 https://t.co/YvbRbq0nxD\",\n  \"claim_ocr\": \"abc\\nAlfonso Cuarón, 'Roma'\\nAchievement in Directing\\nGMA\\nThank you so much.\\nClip Courtesy A.M.P.A.S © 2019\\n\",\n  \"document_image\": \"http://pbs.twimg.com/media/D0O2VPSX4AAsG3T.jpg?format=jpg&name=large\",\n  \"document\": \"\\n  Hollywood’s ‘Three Amigos’ are celebrating another Oscar win.  \\n\\n  Alfonso Cuarón on Sunday became the fifth Mexican director to win best director in six years.  \\n\\n  “I want to thank the Academy for recognizing a film centered around an indigenous woman, one of the 70 million domestic workers in the world without work rights, a character that has historically been relegated in the background in cinema,” Cuarón said.  “As artists our job is to look where others don’t. ” \\n\\n  Guillermo Del Toro – who presented the statuette to Cuarón – was last year’s victor, taking the award for “The Shape of Water. ” \\n\\n  The third member of the “Three Amigos,” as they are affectionately known, is Alejandro G.

Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services stated that Indian markets witnessed a highly volatile trade due to weak global market and reports of Indo-China border tension.  \\\"Policy decisions of the US Fed meeting which will commence tomorrow will drive the global market in the coming days.

Of the Sensex constituents, 21 closed in the red and only nine in the green.  Among the gainers were Axis Bank, Sun Pharma, Bajaj Auto, Bajaj FinServ, HDFC Bank and Dr Reddy’s.

Trump: 'We can never let this happen to another president again'In his first remarks on special counsel Robert Mueller since his report was turned in Friday, President Donald Trump on Monday offered an opinion in sharp contrast to the past two years of insults he's hurled at both the special counsel and his investigation. \\\"Do you think Robert Mueller acted honorably? ” ABC News Chief White House Correspondent Jon Karl asked the president during an event with Israeli Prime Minister Benyamin Netanyahu.  \\\"Yes, he did,\\\" Trump responded.  Trump has previously described Mueller as “conflicted,” “disgraced” and a “liar. ”Asked at an Oval Office photo-op a few minutes later if he still believed the investigation was a witch hunt, Trump said it ended the way it should have but went on for far too long.  Trump added that no other president should have to face an investigation like it ever again. \\\"It's 100 percent the way it should have been.  I wish it could have gone a lot sooner, a lot quicker.  There are a lot of people out there that have done some very, very evil things, very bad things, I would say treasonous things against our country,\\\" Trump said.  \\\"Those people will certainly be looked at.  I've been looking at them for a long time and I'm saying 'why haven't they been looked at? ' Congress, many of them you know who they are.  They've done so many evil things,\\\" Trump said. \\\"I will tell you I love this country.  I love this country as much as I can anything -- my family, my country, my God, but what they did was a false narrative.  It was a terrible thing.  We can never let this happen to another president again.  I can tell you that.  Very few people I know could have handled it.  We can never, ever let this happen to another president again. \\\"Trump also reiterated his view Attorney General William Barr should decide whether to make the full report becomes public. \\\"Up to the attorney general, wouldn't bother me at all,\\\" Trump said, referring to a public release.  Trump also said he isn't thinking about pardoning anyone sentenced during the probe. The summary of the report, submitted to Congress Sunday by Barr, said there was no evidence of collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russian government.  Mueller did not come to a conclusion on obstruction of justice, according to Barr's summary, so Barr took that on himself, concluding that the evidence Muller found didn't support a charge, although Barr didn't reveal all that Mueller discovered. Congressional Democrats continue to demand the full report from Mueller. Last week, the president told reporters at the White House, \\\"let it come out, let people see it. \\\"The president has claimed \\\"complete and total exoneration\\\" from the report, which White House press secretary Sarah Sanders insisted was justified despite Mueller stating, according to Barr, that his not making a decision on the question did not amount to an exoneration on the matter of obstruction. Sanders was asked on NBC Monday morning to acknowledge that it was incorrect to say the report is a full vindication for the president. \\\"Not at all.  It is,\\\" she said. \\\"It is a complete and total exoneration, and here's why, because the special counsel, they said they couldn't make a decision one way or the other.  The way the process works is then they leave that up to the attorney general.  The attorney general and the deputy attorney general went through and based their decision on Mueller's investigation.  This wasn't based on just their own ideas and their own thinking.  It was based on Mueller's investigation,\\\" Sanders said. Critics, however, rejected Trump's claims of exoneration -- and rejected the notion that Barr was objective in his summary. \\\"Given Mr.  Barr’s public record of bias against the Special Counsel’s inquiry, he is not a neutral observer and is not in a position to make objective determinations about the report,\\\" Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said in a statement over the weekend. Democratic Rep.  Jerry Nadler, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, criticized Barr's quick turnover of a summary on an investigation that took almost two years and said Barr is likely to be subpoenaed to explain his actions and conclusions. \\\"We will ask the attorney general to testify before the House Judiciary Committee.  We will demand the release of the full report.  The American people are entitled to a full accounting of the president's misconduct referenced by the special counsel,\\\" Nadler said at a press conference over the weekend in New York district. . In a tweet over the weekend, Nadler described \\\"very concerning discrepancies\\\" within the report and \\\"final decision making at the Justice Department. \\\" The report \\\"did not exonerate the President,\\\" Nadler tweeted. Former U. S.  attorney for the Southern District of New York, Preet Bharara, said that while the case on collusion \\\"is closed,\\\" on the issue of obstruction of justice, \\\"we're sort of not done. \\\"\\\"It seems to me it was a very close case.  Bob Mueller decided not to make a determination about whether or not a charge can be brought, and you only do that if there is substantial evidence of obstruction,\\\" Bharara said on ABC's \\\"Good Morning America\\\" Monday. While it's clear Congress will continue to investigate the questions around obstruction of justice, it remains to be seen whether the president will be receptive to those questions. Asked on \\\"Good Morning America\\\" if the president was prepared to cooperate with any continuing investigations in the House, one of the president's lawyers, Jay Sekulow, said it would be a waste of taxpayer money, listing off all of the evidence Mueller obtained in the probe that lasted the past 22 months. “I think the reality is that Congress is wasting the taxpayers' money, frankly, and they should be going about legislating and governing rather than continuing this that is a prerogative they have,” Sekulow said.  “I think at this point it’s ridiculous to put people through this. ”Trump went as far as to call the entire investigation an \\\"“illegal takedown that failed\\\" on Sunday.  Trump made the claim despite Mueller having been appointed as special counsel by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein after the president's own decision to fire then-FBI Director James Comey, who was leading an investigation into possible Trump campaign's ties to Russia.  Trump and congressional Republicans have claimed that there was wrongdoing in the way the investigation was carried out. Counselor to the president Kellyanne Conway aired those grievances Monday morning, sharing sharp criticism of those who \\\"let this lie fly for two years, hanging and harrassing and trying to embarass -- and worse -- those of us connected to the 2016 campaign. \\\" Those critics now owe Trump, his family and the country an apology, Conway said on Fox News. Conway specifically called out Rep.  Adam Schiff, a critic of the president and a Democrat who heads the House Intelligence Committee. \\\"He ought to resign today,\\\" Conway said.  \\\"He has been on every TV show 50 times a day for practically the last two years promising Americans that the president would either be impeached or indicted. \\\"Conway also previewed the way the administration will seek to use the Mueller report in the face of upcoming Congressional investigations, despite almost two years spent escalating attacks on the investigation and Mueller as biased and a witch hunt. \\\"Bob Mueller already ran the fair and the full investigation.  And any partisan, politicized investigation from here on in will never have the credibility of the Mueller investigation, and the credibility of Attorney General Barr and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein -- what they have done here,\\\" Conway said. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events\",\n  \"document_ocr\": \"abc\\nNEWS\\n\",\n  \"Category\": \"Insufficient_Text\"\n}, {\n  \"Id\": 34898,\n  \"claim_image\": \"http://pbs.twimg.com/media/E1VVVhNVoAIn4Hh.png?format=jpg&name=large\",\n  \"claim\": \"Our Govt has decided to consider workers employed in Pharmaceuticals/medicine supply chain from production to retailing as frontline #COVID healthcare warriors.

SK Rungta, general secretary of the National Federation of the Blind, said, “Due to the increase in Covid-19 cases in the country, the general public is facing a lot of problems in getting tests done.  But the problem for people with disabilities has increased manifold.  A lot of labs are not doing home collection and then there are long queues for testing.  It is impossible for a blind person to go and stand in a queue.  Similarly, for vaccination and treatment, priority should be given to people with disabilities.  We have received several complaints from across the country about the problems disabled face for getting their Covid-19 tests done or vaccination. ”An official from the department of empowerment of persons with disabilities said that they have received similar representations from different organisations and activists from across the country. Rungta added, “We have written to both the health ministry and the department of empowerment of persons with disabilities.

Elizabeth Collado, the church minister’s daughter, told ABC Philadelphia station WPVI on Wednesday that the church “never had any problems with anybody around here. ”“You know, it makes us cry,” she continued.  “We were talking about homelessness before.  This feels like homelessness.  Where do we go to worship?  This is our house of worship. ”The second fire occurred around 2 a. m.  Thursday morning.  Police said that the fire was extinguished quickly and that it was contained to the roof of the building, where officials said it appeared someone had climbed up and ignited an accelerant. Torres was arrested Friday in Allentown and arraigned on criminal charges Friday night, police said.  It was not immediately clear if he had any connection to the church. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events\",\n  \"document_ocr\": \"AprilGarmizThe Morning Call via AR\\n\",\n  \"Category\": \"Insufficient_Text\"\n}, {\n  \"Id\": 34908,\n  \"claim_image\": \"http://pbs.twimg.com/media/D0clcRYV4AAIwlQ.png?format=jpg&name=large\",\n  \"claim\": \"NEW: Pres.

The schoolgirl said her family approached the police on July 20 after the accused uploaded the video of the crime on social media.  The victim’s mother said the family went to the Hiranagar police station but the officials didn’t register a case. They then approached a local court on July 21. “We then went to a court in Hiranagar, which directed the women’s police cell to lodge an FIR (First Information Report ) and investigate the case,” the victim’s mother said. A senior police officer said acting upon the court orders, Kathua Police registered a case under sections 376, 109 and 67 of the Ranbir Penal Code, those of information technology act and the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act against the two accused identified as Vishal and Aman.  Both the men belong to Doonga village in Hiranagar. “We will arrest them soon,” he added. The schoolgirl said she was raped inside the Roohi Resorts at Kootah Morh on Jammu-Pathankot highway in May and that Vishal had filmed the crime on his mobile phone.  She said she had gone to the resort with a friend.  “Vishal pushed me into a room and took out a dagger.  He also slapped me and asked me to have sexual relations.  When I refused, he raped me.  He also shot a video of mine and threatened me to circulate it on social media, if I dared to tell the incident to anyone,” the girl, who had her face covered, said while speaking to reporters on Thursday in Kathua. The mother also said the families of both the accused had offered them money to them to take back their case and sort out the matter. “The family of the rapist has also offered a marriage proposal.  How sick on their part?  I want justice for my daughter,” she said. The accused are the victim’s classmates and were appearing as private students for the higher secondary examination in government higher secondary school in Kootah. Kathua has been in the news after the brutal gangrape and murder of an eight-year-old nomadic girl inside a temple in January last year.  The girl was kidnapped on January 10 and her body was found on January 17. A local court in Pathankot had on June 10 this year sentenced the temple’s priest Sanji Ram, dismissed special police officer Deepak Khajuria and Parvesh Kumar to life imprisonment while sacked policemen Anand Dutta, Tilak Raj and Surender Verma were handed five years in jail. \",\n  \"document_ocr\": \"no.\\nENOUGH\\nIS\\nENOUGH\\n\",\n  \"Category\": \"Insufficient_Text\"\n}, {\n  \"Id\": 34910,\n  \"claim_image\": \"http://pbs.twimg.com/media/EwGdIj3U8AIbbn3.jpg?format=jpg&name=large\",\n  \"claim\": \"With Mallikarjun Kharge, Rahul Gandhi’s control over Congress' parliamentary wings is complete\\n\\n(reports @SaubhadraC)\\n\\nhttps://t.co/GTvyEwI0QU https://t.co/Mamkbj9KK1\",\n  \"claim_ocr\": \"\",\n  \"document_image\": \"http://pbs.twimg.com/media/EuWO1GmXYAA0Ws7.jpg?format=jpg&name=large\",\n  \"document\": \"Former Union minister Mallikarjun Kharge’s appointment as the Leader of the Opposition in Rajya Sabha will deepen Rahul Gandhi’s influence over his party’s parliamentary wings, Congress leaders said. Kharge is known to enjoy Gandhi’s trust.  Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, the Congress Lok Sabha floor leader, is considered as one of Gandhi’s “trusted lieutenants” in the party’s inner circle. A proposal to appoint former Union minister Manish Tewari as the Congress floor leader in the lower House received a lukewarm response from the top leadership and instead Chowdhury was appointed as the leader in 2019.  “Rahul Gandhi’s equation with Manish Tewari had soured in the last few years after the latter did not fight the Lok Sabha polls in 2014,” said a Congress leader considered close to Gandhi, requesting anonymity. Also Read | Help raise voice of the weak: Rahul to cadresPersonal equations have played a role, but Kharge and Chowdhury are also seen to be more aggressive, party leaders said. Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha proceedings have been disrupted this week over spiralling fuel prices.  On Wednesday, the Rajya Sabha failed to transact business due to Congress-led protests in the Upper House over fuel prices and farm laws. Congress leaders said protests and disruptions will be more frequent as Kharge-led party in the House was unlikely to take a softer line and take the BJP head-on in sync with Gandhi’s approach. The Congress has rejected the presiding officer’s suggestion to discuss the oil price issue during the debates on demand for grants and finance bill. In the first part of the ongoing budget session, when Ghulam Nabi Azad led the Congress in Rajya Sabha, the party agreed to join the discussions after a few days of protests even as its Lok Sabha wing continued its protests over the farm laws. Gandhi is believed to have been miffed with the party’s approach in Rajya Sabha and praised the Lok Sabha unit for its continued protests. Prime Minister Narendra Modi highlighted this division to attack the party and said, in his reply to the President’s debate, that a “confused and divided” Congress cannot be any good to the nation.  Later, in an interview with HT, Azad rejected Modi comments.  “It was a decision by all Opposition parties to stop protests and join the discussions,” Azad said. A Congress strategist said with Kharge in charge and deputy leader Anand Sharma almost sidelined in the party’s strategy making, such division for the Congress is unlikely to happen anymore.  “Kharge and Chowdhury—both Gandhi loyalists—in charge of the party will adopt a more coordinated approach in sync with Congress high command’s directions,” the strategist said on condition of anonymity. \",\n  \"document_ocr\": \"ANI\\n\",\n  \"Category\": \"Insufficient_Text\"\n}, {\n  \"Id\": 34911,\n  \"claim_image\": \"http://pbs.twimg.com/media/EvtJndLVgAI6wJb.png?format=jpg&name=large\",\n  \"claim\": \"Tamil Nadu: Congress MP Karti P Chidambaram has filed an application before the party's state election committee  requesting that Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra be named as the candidate for the by-polls to Kanyakumari Lok Sabha constituency https://t.co/BVegDsF9fQ\",\n  \"claim_ocr\": \"TAN DU\\nESS\\n\",\n  \"document_image\": \"http://pbs.twimg.com/media/Evtc6VsU8AAOF9a.jpg?format=jpg&name=large\",\n  \"document\": \"Congress leader Karti Chidambaram has filed an application before the party's state election committee, requesting that Priyanka Gandhi Vadra should be named as candidate for the by-polls to Kanyakumari Lok Sabha constituency.

Chief Metropolitan Magistrate Gurmohina Kaur granted the relief to the foreigners on furnishing a personal bond of Rs 10,000 each. Till date, 445 foreign nationals from 33 different countries, who were charge-sheeted in the case have been granted bail by the court. The police had in June filed 59 charge sheets, including supplementaries, against 956 foreigners belonging to 36 different countries in the case. The accused who were granted bail Saturday will file their plea bargaining applications on Monday, said advocates Ashima Mandla, Mandakini Singh and Fahim Khan, appearing for them.   Under plea bargaining, the accused plead guilty to the offence, praying for a lesser punishment.  The Criminal Procedure Code allows for plea bargaining in cases where the maximum punishment is a seven-year imprisonment; offences don’t affect the socio-economic conditions of the society and the offence is not committed against a woman or a child below 14 years of age. During the hearing, all the foreigners were produced before the court through video conferencing. The court had granted bail to 122 Malaysians on Tuesday and 91 other foreigners from 21 countries on Wednesday, 76 foreign nationals from eight countries on Thursday and 82 Bangaldeshi nationals on Friday.   The investigating officer had earlier told the court that the investigation was completed against the 956 foreigners in the case and each has been allegedly found to have independently committed the offence for which he /she has been charge-sheeted. Further investigations are pending, the IO said. These foreigners had attended the event in March, following which in April Covid-19 cases across the country spiked after hundreds of Tablighi Jamaat members, who had attended the religious congregation at Nizamuddin Markaz, tested positive. According to the chargesheets, all the foreigners have been booked for violation of visa rules, guidelines issued in the wake of Covid-19 pandemic, Epidemic Diseases Act, Disaster Management Act and prohibitory orders under section 144 of Code of Criminal Procedure. They have also been booked for offences under sections 188 (Disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant), 269 (Negligent act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life), 270 (Malignant act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life) and 271 (Disobedience to quarantine rule) of the Indian Penal Code and relevant sections of the Foreigners Act. The punishment for these offences ranges from six months to eight years’ imprisonment. The Centre has cancelled their visas and blacklisted them.  The foreigners have not been arrested yet and are residing at various places approved by the Delhi High Court. At least 9,000 people including the foreign nationals participated in the religious congregation of the Tablighi Jamaat at Nizamuddin Markaz.  Later, many of the attendees travelled to various parts of the country. An FIR was registered against Tablighi Jamaat leader Maulana Saad Kandhalvi and six others on March 31 on a complaint of the Station House Officer of Nizamuddin under sections of the Epidemic Diseases Act, Disaster Management Act (2005), Foreigners Act and other relevant sections of Indian Penal Code. Kandhalvi was later booked for culpable homicide not amounting to murder after some of the attendees of the religious congregation died due to Covid-19, police said.  \",\n  \"document_ocr\": \"AON RON\\n\",\n  \"Category\": \"Insufficient_Text\"\n}, {\n  \"Id\": 34913,\n  \"claim_image\": \"http://pbs.twimg.com/media/Ei3yMKSWkAEjshS.jpg?format=jpg&name=large\",\n  \"claim\": \"“Should I be confirmed, I will be mindful of who came before me,” Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett says about Ruth Bader Ginsburg. “…She not only broke glass ceilings, she smashed them.” https://t.co/9iuIR1ng1T https://t.co/9sCacblALG\",\n  \"claim_ocr\": \"White House Rose Garden\\n5:16 PM ET\\nBREAKING NEWS\\nTRUMP NOMINATES AMY CONEY BARRETT AS SUPREME COURT JUSTICE CNN\\nJudge Amy Coney Barrett | Supreme Court Nominee\\n2:16 PM PT\\nSITUATION ROOM\\nPRES\\nく\\n*****\\nLIN\\n\",\n  \"document_image\": \"http://pbs.twimg.com/media/Ei3vYhWWAAAkh4g.jpg?format=jpg&name=large\",\n  \"document\": \"The move sets up what promises to be a bitter confirmation fight. President Trump announces Supreme Court nomineePresident Donald Trump on Saturday announced his nomination of federal Judge Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court to fill the seat of the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. The move to select Barrett sets up what promises to be a bitter confirmation fight less than two months before Election Day -- an unexpected twist in an election season already fraught with the coronavirus pandemic and attempts by the president to undermine confidence in the result. It also promises to upend the relative ideological balance that has marked the court for decades, establishing a clear conservative majority should Trump's nominee be seated. \\\"Judge Barrett was confirmed to the circuit court three years ago by a bipartisan vote.  Her qualifications are unsurpassed.  Unsurpassed and her record is beyond reproach.  This should be a straightforward and prompt confirmation,\\\" Trump said during the Rose Garden announcement. He added, \\\"Rulings that the Supreme Court will issue in the coming years will decide the survival of our Second Amendment, our religious liberty, our public safety and so much more.  To maintain security, liberty and prosperity, we must preserve our priceless heritage of a nation of laws.  And there's no one better to do that than Amy Coney Barrett. \\\"Upon her nomination, Barrett said, \\\"I love the United States, and I love the United States' Constitution.  I'm truly humbled by the prospect of serving on the Supreme Court. \\\"A devout Catholic, mother of seven and the favored choice of conservative groups, Barrett is a relative newcomer to the federal bench, having served just three years on the Chicago-based 7th Circuit Court of Appeals.  Despite her short tenure as a federal judge, the longtime Notre Dame Law professor emerged as the front-runner on Trump's shortlist in the days following Ginsburg's death. At 48, Barrett is the youngest Supreme Court nominee since Clarence Thomas in 1991, and could expect to serve well into the middle of the century – an attractive prospect to Trump and his allies on Capitol Hill. Barrett's appeal within the administration has also been shaped in part by her reputation as a protégé of the late Justice Antonin Scalia, an icon of the religious right for whom she once clerked, sources said. For Democrats, Barrett's conservative tilt and religious affiliation – expressed largely through her prolific catalog of scholarly writings – made her approval to the federal bench in 2017 a bitter affair.  During a combative confirmation hearing for the post, Barrett became a rock star in conservative circles – not for what she told the committee, but what a powerful Senator said to her. \\\"Whatever a religion is, it has its own dogma.  The law is totally different,\\\" said California Sen.  Dianne Feinstein, the committee's ranking Democrat.  \\\"I think in your case, professor … the dogma lives loudly within you, and that is of concern. \\\"Feinstein's comments drew rebukes from religious freedom groups and Republican senators.  Her phrase, \\\"the dogma lives loudly within you,\\\" has since made its way onto tee shirts and mugs for sale on the internet. During the same hearing, Barrett said, \\\"I take my faith seriously and I'm a faithful Catholic,\\\" but assured senators that it is \\\"never appropriate to impose a judge's personal convictions, whether they arise from faith or anywhere else, on the law. \\\"Professor Rick Garnett, a former colleague and Barrett's neighbor, said the \\\"grace\\\" with which Barrett fielded Feinstein's remarks appealed to religious conservatives and improved her standing with those in the administration. \\\"The way she handled that [hearing] elevated her in the public conversation,\\\" Garnett told ABC News.  \\\"It's not just that some of the senators said some strange things about religion, but it was that then-Professor Barrett handled it in a dignified way and I think it made a lot of Americans – religious believers of all stripes – feel inspired and proud. \\\"Eventually, the Senate approved her nomination 55-43, with just three Democrats voting across party lines. A self-described originalist, Barrett's tenure as an appellate judge has affirmed her conservative credentials.  She authored a 2018 dissent arguing that convicted felons should not be barred from having guns.  And while she has not issued a ruling yet on abortion, she has twice staked out positions aligned with the anti-abortion movement. Prior to her judgeship, Barrett made a name for herself at Notre Dame Law School, also her alma mater.  During her 2017 confirmation process, her Notre Dame Law colleagues penned a glowing – and unanimous – endorsement letter.  More than 450 former students also advocated her confirmation. She supplemented her time in the classroom – where she taught courses on federal courts, constitutional law, and statutory interpretation – with several scholarly articles on subjects ranging from Supreme Court precedent to due process. In her scholarly work, Barrett has argued for Catholic judges to recuse themselves from death penalty cases, citing the \\\"the moral impossibility of enforcing capital punishment,\\\" and suggested that legal precedent is susceptible to being overturned, leading critics to question how she would consider the landmark abortion ruling Roe v.  Wade.  In 2013, Barrett was quoted in the Notre Dame student newspaper as saying that \\\"it is very unlikely at this point that the court is going to overturn Roe [v.  Wade]. \\\"During the 2017 confirmation, Barrett walked back her position on the death penalty, telling senators that she would not recuse \\\"as a blanket matter\\\" from capital punishment cases.  On abortion, she stood by past comments that \\\"abortion … is always immoral,\\\" but added that, if confirmed, her \\\"views on this or any other question will have no bearing on the discharge of [her] duties as a judge. \\\"Scrutiny of Barrett's faith has also extended to her personal affiliations, particularly her longtime ties to a Charismatic Christian community called People of Praise. The group encourages its more than 1,700 members to make a covenant to the community, and it also assigns younger members a personal mentor, known as a \\\"head\\\" or \\\"leader. \\\" Until recently, women in those roles were referred to as \\\"handmaids,\\\" which led some news outlets and commentators to speculate that People of Praise may have been the inspiration behind Margaret Atwood's famous novel, \\\"The Handmaid's Tale. \\\" Both Atwood and People of Praise denied those claims. Barrett has not spoken publicly about her involvement in People of Praise, and neither the group nor an aide to Barrett would comment on her current status with the organization.  Critics suggest her ties to the community and a covenant many members make – which the group describes as \\\"a promise of love and service we choose to make to one another\\\" – may conflict with her oath to uphold the constitution.  For its part, People of Praise denies that its practices would have any effect on a member's professional life. Barrett's confirmation process is expected to be strained by the political pressure of a nomination and hearing so close to a presidential election. Democrats have accused Republicans of hypocrisy in moving forward with a replacement for Ginsburg, who died last week with only 45 days before the November vote.  In 2016, Republicans blocked President Barack Obama's Supreme Court nominee, Judge Merrick Garland, after Scalia's death more than 200 days before the election. A native of Louisiana, Barrett attended Rhodes College in Memphis, Tenn. , for undergraduate studies before earning her law degree summa cum laude from the Notre Dame in 1997.  After graduating law school, Barrett clerked for Judge Laurence Silberman of the D. C.  Circuit Court of Appeals and then Scalia before a brief stint in private practice in Washington, D. C. Her husband, Jesse Barrett, served as an Assistant U. S.  Attorney in the Northern District of Indiana. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events\",\n  \"document_ocr\": \"abc NEWSLIVE\\nOF THE\\nRESIDENT\\nUNIT\\n*******\\n\",\n  \"Category\": \"Insufficient_Text\"\n}, {\n  \"Id\": 34914,\n  \"claim_image\": \"http://pbs.twimg.com/media/DydbhY9UwAApOV_.jpg?format=jpg&name=large\",\n  \"claim\": \"Amit Shah at launch of #BharatKeMannKiBaat in Delhi:Before 2014,for over 30 yrs,there were coalition govts.

Impeachment hearings become civics lesson for Pennsylvania middle schoolersOn Day 5 of the House impeachment hearings, Fiona Hill, a former Russia expert on the National Security Council, and David Holmes, a political counselor at U. S.  embassy in Ukraine, testifed following a day of explosive testimony on Wednesday.  Hill  has described a July 10 White House meeting with Ukrainian officials in which Gordon Sondland, Trump’s pick for ambassador to the European Union, pressured Ukraine for a political investigation and insisted acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney had agreed to the plan.  Following the meeting, Hill said John Bolton, the president’s national security adviser at the time, told her to tell the president’s legal adviser, “that I am not part of whatever drug deal Sondland and Mulvaney are cooking up. ”Holmes has described a July 26 phone conversation between President Trump  and Sondland where he said he overheard the president asking Sondland about \\\"the investigations. \\\"Here is how the hearing unfolded.  4:19 p. m. ABC's Benjamin Siegel reports from the hearing room: This was Schiff as angry and emotional as I've ever seen him in one of these settings. He denounced Republicans, and attempted to dismantle their defense of the president.  Drawing on his background as a prosecutor, he laid out the case Democrats believe they have assembled against the president. Schiff said Trump's alleged conduct is \\\"far more serious\\\" than Watergate and \\\"beyond anything that Nixon did. \\\"\\\"The difference between then and now is not the difference between Nixon and Trump.  It's the difference between that Congress and this one. \\\" \\\"Where is Howard Baker?  Where are the people that are willing to go beyond their party to look to their duty? \\\"Schiff noted that he was one of the most prominent holdouts against impeachment.  For months, when asked by reporters about his position, he warned that pursuing impeachment along party lines would fail. In his closing remarks, he said that it all came down to \\\"timing,\\\" and the fact that Trump's call with Zelenskiy took place one day after Mueller testified. \\\"I resisted going down this path for a long time, but I will tell you why I could resist no more.  And it came down to this.  It actually came down to timing.  It came down to the fact that the day after Bob Mueller testified, the day after Bob Mueller testified that Donald Trump invited Russian interference, hey, Russia, if you're listening, come get Hillary's emails, and later that day, they tried to hack her server.  The day after he testified that not only did Trump invite that interference, but that he welcomed the help in the campaign, they made full use of it.  They lied about it.  They obstructed the investigation into it,\\\" Schiff said. \\\"The day after that, Donald Trump is back on the phone asking another nation to involve itself in another U. S.  election,\\\" he added. As he closed, he invoked the late Elijah Cummings, his voice breaking with emotion:\\\"That says to me, this president believes that he is above the law, beyond accountability.  And in my view, there is nothing more dangerous than an unethical president who believes they are above the law.  And I would just say to people watching here at home and around the world, in the words of my great colleague, \\\"We are better than that. \\\"4:13 p. m. Nunes wrapped up the scheduled public hearings by again calling the process a \\\"show trial\\\" and accusing the Democrats of pursuing a predetermined outcome to hurt President Trump. \\\"What you see in this room over the past two weeks is a show trial.  The plane a result of three years of political operations and dirty tricks.  Campaigns waged against this president.  And like any good show trial, the verdict was decided before the trials ever began.  After all, after denouncing the president for years as a Russian agent and a threat to democracy, how could the Democrats not impeach him? \\\" he said. Nunes said Republicans don't know if there will be more public hearings or the exact next steps for the process but said \\\"this farce will soon move to the judiciary committee where impeachment rightfully belongs. \\\"Schiff then countered some of the minority's complaints about how the impeachment inquiry has been conducted, quipping \\\"only over 100 members of congress are able to participate in those secret depositions. \\\"3:41 p. m. Hill testified that she did not think Ambassador Sondland's claim that he didn't realize the connection between the energy company Burisma and Hunter Biden was credible, saying that combined with references to 2016 she thought the implication was clear. \\\"It is not credible to me that he was oblivious.  He did not say Bidens, however, he said Burisma, he said 2016.  I took it to mean the elections as well as Burisma,\\\" she said. 3:39 p. m. Democratic Rep.  Sean Maloney referenced an ABC News/Ipsos poll that found 70% of Americans think President Donald Trump’s request to a foreign leader to investigate his political rival was wrong as the hearing with Hill and Holmes wraps up. That poll found that a slim majority of Americans, 51%, believe Trump’s actions were both wrong and he should be impeached and removed from office.  But only 21% of Americans say they are following the hearings very closely. 3:22 p. m. ABC's Benjamin Siegel in the hearing room reports on two notable moments from moderate Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee -- the latest indication Republicans remain united in their opposition to impeachment after nearly 30 hours of public witness testimony. Rep.  Mike Turner, R-Ohio, who has criticized Trump's comments on the phone call with Zelenskiy as being \\\"not OK,\\\" appeared to mock Democrats impeachment efforts. \\\"Do you guys want to be the laughingstock of history to impeach a president for not taking a meeting?  Oh God, please undertake that,\\\" he asked rhetorically. Republican Rep.  Will Hurd said he found President Trump's July 25 call with Ukrainian President Zelenskiy \\\"inappropriate\\\" and \\\"misguided,\\\" but said he hasn't seen any blatant evidence he engaged in an impeachable act. \\\"We have heard of U. S.  officials carrying uncoordinated confusing an conflicting messages that created doubt and uncertainty in Kiev at a time when they knew [a] reformist administration has just taken office and was ready to fight corruption and work with us to advance other U. S.  objectives,\\\" he said.   \\\"I disagree with this sort of bungling foreign policy. \\\"\\\"An impeachable offense should be compelling, overwhelmingly clear and unambiguous.  And it's not something to be rushed or taken lightly.  I have not heard evidence proving the president committed bribery or extortion,\\\" Hurd said. 2:52  p. m. Democratic Rep.  Jackie Speier asked Hill about an anecdote where one of Hill's pigtails were set on fire by a boy while she was taking a test when she was 11 years old. \\\"You turned around with your hands snuffed out the fire and proceeded to finish your test.  Is that a true story? \\\" Speier asked. Hill said it was true and she was surprised to see it surface.  The anecdote was included in a New York Times profile of Hill. \\\"It is a true story.  Unfortunate consequences afterwards.  My mom gave me a bowl haircut.  So, for the photograph later in that week I looked like Richard III,\\\" Hill said. 2:30 p. m. ABC's Katherine Faulders reports from inside the hearing room that GOP Rep.  Mike Turner just spent five minutes attacking Hill's credibility, saying \\\"you have provided me probably the greatest piece of evidence that's before us to illustrate the problem with hearsay. \\\"\\\"Do you guys want to be the laughingstock of history to impeach a president for not taking a meeting?  Oh God, please undertake that. \\\"\\\"Is there a question for Dr.  Hill? \\\" her lawyer replied.  There wasn't. Later, after GOP Rep.  Brad Wenstrup made remarks about his military service and shared concerns about partisanship and hatred, Hill commented it was a shame Turner and another Republican Rep.  John Ratcliffe, had left the room and thanked Wenstrup for his comments, calling them eloquent and moving. \\\"\\\"I think all of us who came here under legal obligation also felt we had a moral obligation to do so.  We came as fact witnesses,\\\" Hill said. \\\"I think it was unfair for people to already call the election and to make attacks also on candidate Trump and on President Trump,\\\" she added. \\\"And I know that this has put a huge cloud over this presidency and also over our whole democratic system.  That's actually why as a non-partisan person and as an expert on Russia and an expert on Vladimir Putin and on the Russian security services I wanted to come in to serve the country to try to see if I could help. \\\"2:20 p. m. GOP Rep.  Jim Jordan, using Rep.  Nunes' time, asks Holmes why Ambassador William Taylor, the top U. S.  diplomat in Ukraine, who testified last week, did not initially tell House impeachment investigators about the July 26 phone call between Trump and Sondland. \\\"Maybe Mr.  Holmes, the takeaway was he thought it was no big deal because he already knew! \\\" Jordan said, appearing to downplay the overheard conversation. \\\"The [Trump-Zelenskiy] transcript had been out for two months.  Maybe the ambassador thought there is nothing new here.  But, shazam, last week you come forward with supposed this new information, and nothing different in there than what we had on the transcript.  Maybe that's the reason their star witness, first witness didn't bring it up.  You're their closing witness. \\\"Holmes, after a testy back-and-forth between Jordan and Schiff, responded. \\\"It was not news for him that the president was pressing for a Biden investigation,\\\" he said.  \\\"It's exactly my point.  I briefed the call and when we come back and I referred to the call and everyone is nodding.  Of course, that's what's going on.  Of course the president is pressing for a Biden investigation before he'll do these things the Ukrainians want.  There is nodding agreement.  Did I go through every single word in the call?  No, because everyone by that point agreed. \\\"\\\"He was involved in a number of other interactions you've outlined that brought him to the same conclusion. \\\"Rep.  John Ratcliffe, R-Texas, then pushed Holmes on his recollection of the phone call, appearing skeptical that Holmes happened to overhear only the part related to Trump and Ukraine. 1:58 p. m. Schiff just asked Hill, who was born and raised in northern England, if she wanted to respond to some of the dual-loyalty attacks her former colleague Lt.  Col.  Alexander Vindman, a Ukraine expert on the National Security Council, has faced over the last few weeks. \\\"Everyone immigrated here at some point in their family history.  Some people perhaps came reluctantly.  Others game by choice as I did, but this is for me the essence of America,\\\" she said. \\\"I'm Anglo-American, I'm British American.  I'm a naturalized citizen.  My loyalty is not to the United Kingdom, it is to my country and the country I serve.  I know there are many natural-raised citizens in my office and across the National Security Council who felt the same way.  I think it is deeply unfair,\\\" Hill said. 1:50 p. m. Hill responded to a question by Schiff about the exchange during which Bolton, according to Hill, called what was happening a \\\"drug deal,” describing the instance in full:Hill said Bolton “was escorting out the Ukrainian visitors along with Secretary Perry and Ambassadors Volker and Sondland,” after the meeting and told Hill to wait in the room. “And I guess they wanted to take a quick photograph outside of his office and I know that Secretary Perry and others tweeted out that photograph -- beautiful, sunny day and a picture of them standing outside ambassador Bolton's office,” Hill said. She went on to say: “This was very quick he came back in at that point they were already moving down to the boardroom because on the way out of Bolton's office, Ambassador Sondland said let's regroup in the boardroom for quick huddle on next steps. ”Hill called this move “quite unusual. ”“When Ambassador Bolton came back into the office, that’s when he gave me the very strong instruction to go downstairs, find out what was being discussed and come right back up and report it to him,” she said. When she arrived at the boardroom, Hill describes seeing Colonel Vindman looking “quite alarmed. ”“When I came in, Ambassador Sondland was in an exchange with Colonel Vindman along the lines of, well, we have an agreement to have this meeting,” she said. Hill said Energy Secretary Rick Perry had left, so he “has no recollection of this meeting because he was not in it. ”“So, when I came in, Gordon Sondland was supposedly saying, look, we have a deal that there will be a meeting.  I have a deal with chief of staff Mulvaney, there will be a meeting if the Ukrainians open up or announce these investigations into 2016 and Burisma and I cut it off immediately there,” Hill recounted. “Because by this point after having heard Giuliani over and over again on the television and all the issues that he was asserting, by this point, it was clear that Burisma was code for the Bidens because Giuliani was laying it out there.  I could see why colonel was alarmed and he [Bolton] said, ‘This is inappropriate, we're the national security council and we can't be involved in this. ’”1:41 p. m. Hill, who said she watched Sondland's testimony carefully on Wednesday, pushed back on his statements that \\\"everyone was in the loop\\\" when it came to Ukraine. Sondland said he was surprised concerns were being raised because so many high-level officials were informed on their efforts.  But Hill said she now understands why they weren't able to work together. \\\"He was absolutely right because he was being involved in a domestic political errand, and we were being involved in national security foreign policy, and those two things had just diverged.  I was irritated with him and angry with him that he wasn't fully coordinating and I did say to him, Ambassador Sondland, I think this is all going to blow up, and here we are,\\\" Hill said. She went on to say that there were discussions about ways to coordinate better, however, Hill said, \\\"His feeling was that the national security council was always trying to block him. \\\"Hill attempted to clarify: \\\"What we were trying to do is block us from straying into domestic or personal politics, and that was precisely what I was trying to do. \\\"1:28 p. m. ABC'S Benjamin Siegel reports from the hearing room: Hill, under questioning from Republicans, said there were \\\"differences\\\" in \\\"understanding\\\" about the Trump-Zelenskiy July 25 call, repeating that she was opposed to a call, and that then-National Security Adviser John Bolton was as well. \\\"I know that Ambassador Sondland said in that email that Bolton was in agreement.  To my knowledge, Bolton was not in agreement at that particular juncture,\\\" she said, referencing an email Sondland cited in his prepared opening statement on Wednesday. \\\"It was based on the fact that he didn't feel the call was properly prepared, and as I said earlier, we wanted to make sure that there was going to be a fulsome, bilateral U. S. -Ukraine agenda that was discussed, which is usual with these calls,\\\" she said. 1:05 p. m. As Fiona Hill answers questions from the Republican side, White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham has put out statement that the witnesses testifying at the impeachment hearing as part of the impeachment inquiry “rely heavily on their own presumptions, assumptions and opinions” and “have no personal or direct knowledge regarding why U. S.  aid was temporarily withheld. ”“The Democrats' are clearly being motivated by a sick hatred for President Trump and their rabid desire to overturn the 2016 election,” Grisham said. 1:01 p. m. Schiff gavels the hearing back into session. The top Republican, Rep.  Devin Nunes, has begun the minority questioning. 11:58 a. m. If you missed testimony from the previous hearings, you can catch up on the key takeaways during the break before testimony resumes. 11:04 a. m. After the Democratic counsel finishes his line of questioning, Schiff calls a break to allow members to vote on measure on the House floor.  That's expected to last at least an hour. Just before, Hill also detailed how she saw Bolton respond when Sondland said in a meeting with Ukrainian officials that \\\"we have an agreement that there will be a meeting if specific investigations are put under way. \\\"She clarified that Sondland later said he had an agreement with acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and that she understood \\\"investigations\\\" to be a reference to investigating Burisma and the Bidens. She said she was Bolton \\\"stiffen\\\" after this comment and end the meeting. She testified that Bolton told her after the meeting to report what happened to the National Security Counsel's top lawyer, John Eisenberg, and tell him that Bolton said, \\\"I am not part of this drug deal that Sondland and Mulvaney are cooking up. \\\"Bolton has thus far declined to testify as part of the impeachment inquiry. ABC's John Santucci reports that a Bolton spokesperson declines to comment on Hill's testimony. 10:55 a. m. When asked about then-National security Adviser John Bolton's comment that Rudy Giuliani, the president's personal lawyer, was a \\\"hand grenade,\\\" Hill responded that she knew what he meant when referencing his concerns about Giuliani's public statements about Ukraine. \\\"I think he meant that, obviously, what Mr.  Giuliani was saying was pretty explosive in any case.  He was frequently on television, making quite incendiary remarks about everyone and that he was clearly  pushing forward issues and ideas that would, you know, probably come back to haunt us,\\\" Hill said. \\\"And, in fact, I think that that's where we are today. \\\"10:50 a. m. ABC's Benjamin Siegel in the hearing room reports that when Holmes was asked to explain his \\\"specific and clear\\\" recollection of part of the Trump-Sondland call, Holmes told the committee it was a \\\"very distinctive experience. \\\"\\\"I've never seen anything like this in my foreign service career, someone at a lunch in a restaurant making a call on a cell phone to the president of the United States, being able to hear his voice, very distinctive personality,\\\" Holmes said. \\\"We've all seen him on television.  Very colorful language was used.  They were directly addressing something that I had been wondering working on for weeks and even months a topic that had led to the recall of my former boss, the former ambassador. \\\"And so here was a person who said he had direct contact with the president, and said that over the course of time.  Here he is, actually having that contact with the president.  Hearing the president's voice and then talking about this issue of the Biden investigation that I had been hearing about,\\\" Holmes said. 10:40 a. m. ABC's Jordyn Phelps at the White House notes that President Trump has taken to Twitter to take issue with Holmes' testimony that a call not on speakerphone could possibly be overheard by another person not on the phone. Holmes had testified a few minutes earlier that Trump was speaking so loudly that Gordon Sondland had held his phone away from his ear and that Holmes, sitting at the table with Sondland, could clearly hear Trump's voice asking about \\\"investigations. \\\"The president notes that he has “been watching people making phone calls my entire life” and that his hearing is “great. ”\\\"@realDonaldTrump: I have been watching people making phone calls my entire life.  My hearing is, and has been, great.  Never have I been watching a person making a call, which was not on speakerphone, and been able to hear or understand a conversation.  I’ve even tried, but to no avail.  Try it live! \\\"10:24 a. m. Schiff thanked Hill for testifying, saying, \\\"Your story reminds me a great deal of what we heard from Alexander Vindman,\\\" recalling Thursday's testimony.  \\\"The few immigrant stories we've heard in the course of these hearings are among the most powerful, I think, I've ever heard.  You and Colonel Vindman and others are the best of this country and you came here by choice.  And we are so blessed that you did, so welcome,\\\" Schiff said. Hill followed up to emphasize that Russia would have tried to delegitimize any American president after 2016, saying the country has a vested interest in damaging relationships between the U. S.  and its allies. Hill said she wanted to make a strong point when she called for Republicans on the committee to stop perpetuating the narrative that Ukraine interfered in the 2016 election, saying that there was a lot of criticism of presidential candidates from all over the world during that election but that Russia especially uses those comments to create chaos in the U. S. \\\"What we're seeing here as a result of all of these narratives, this is exactly what the Russian government was hoping for.  If they seed misinformation, they seed doubt, they have everybody questioning the legitimacy of a presidential candidate, be it president Trump or potentially a president Clinton, that they would pit one side of our electorate against the other, that they would pit one party against the other,\\\" Hill said. 10:12 a. m. As noted earlier, in her opening statement, Hill warns the \\\"fictional narrative\\\" that Ukraine interfered in American elections and not Russia.  The consensus among intelligence agencies and congressional investigators is that Russia has sought to interfere in American elections for decades and actively did so in 2016. She blasted Republicans and other partisan figures who have perpetuated misinformation about Ukraine, saying political divisions make it harder to combat the problem. \\\"Some of you on this committee appear to believe that Russia and its security services did not conduct a campaign against our country and that perhaps, somehow, for some reason, Ukraine did,\\\" she says. \\\"This is a fictional narrative,\\\" Hill says emphatically. “The unfortunate truth is that Russia was the foreign power that systematically attacked our democratic institutions in 2016.  This is the public conclusion of our intelligence agencies, confirmed in bipartisan congressional reports.  It is beyond dispute, even if some of the underlying details must remain classified,\\\" Hill says. \\\"I refuse to be part of an effort to legitimize an alternate narrative that the Ukrainian government is a U. S.  adversary, and that Ukraine—not Russia—attacked us in 2016,\\\" Hill  says. \\\"When we are consumed by partisan rancor, we cannot combat these external forces as they seek to divide us against each another, degrade our institutions, and destroy the faith of the American people in our democracy,\\\" Hill says. 9:57 a. m. Holmes described his recollection of a phone call between Sondland and Trump on July 26, the day after the controversial call between Trump and Zelenskiy. Holmes said he could hear Trump's voice on the other end of the line during the call, saying he asked \\\"So, he's gonna do the investigation? \\\" in reference to Zelenskiy.  He said Sondland responded that Zelenskiy will \\\"do anything you ask him to. \\\"After Sondland hung up with the president Holmes said he described Trump as being \\\"in a bad mood. \\\"\\\"I then took the opportunity to ask Ambassador Sondland for his candid impression of the President’s views on Ukraine.  In particular, I asked Ambassador Sondland if it was true that the President did not “give a s--t about Ukraine. ” Ambassador Sondland agreed that the President did not “give a s--t about Ukraine,” Holmes said. \\\"I asked why not, and Ambassador Sondland stated that the President only cares about “big stuff. ” I noted that there was “big stuff” going on in Ukraine, like a war with Russia, and Ambassador Sondland replied that he meant “big stuff” that benefits the President, like the “Biden investigation” that Mr.  Giuliani was pushing. \\\"Sondland testified Wednesday that he does not recall specific details of his call with the president but has no reason to doubt Holmes testimony. ABC's Benjamin Siegel reports from the hearing room that Holmes' testimony, like Sondland's, again underscores how limited Democrats' investigation has been by the Trump administration's refusal to cooperate with subpoenas and the impeachment inquiry. Recalling the U. S.  delegation's visit to Ukraine for Zelenskiy's inauguration in May, Holmes recalled a conversation between Energy Secretary Perry and Zelenskiy about energy sector reform, where Perry passed Holmes a list of \\\"people he trusts\\\" on the subject, which was a topic of \\\"subsequent meetings\\\" between Perry and Ukrainian energy officials. \\\"Embassy personnel were excluded from these later meetings by Secretary Perry's staff,\\\" Holmes said. Perry and the Energy Department have refused to cooperate with Democrats, making it difficult for the committee to follow up with any questions about these meetings that took place without embassy staff. Leadership hasn't stated it publicly, but Democrats and aides tell ABC News the Intelligence Committee is likely to transmit its work to the Judiciary Committee around the beginning of December, and that the House remains on track to vote on articles of impeachment  by the end of the year. 9:50 a. m. Holmes says Sondland told him the Ukrainian president needed to make clear he would not stand in the way of \\\"investigations,\\\" which Holmes said he understood to mean investigations into the Burisma energy company and the Bidens. \\\"While Ambassador Taylor did not brief me on every detail of his communications with 'The Three Amigos,' he did tell me that on a June 28 call with President Zelenskiy, Ambassador Taylor, and the Three Amigos, it was made clear that some action on a Burisma/Biden investigation was a precondition for an Oval Office meeting,\\\" he says. Holmes says he became concerned that even if the two presidents met Trump may not show sufficient support for Ukraine, which he said could have been more damaging to the relationship between the two countries. 9:45 a. m. In his opening statement, Holmes details his knowledge of the allegations against former Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch, who was removed from her role, and the impact of her removal on the relationship between the U. S.  and incoming Ukrainian administration. \\\"The barrage of allegations directed at Ambassador Yovanovitch, a career ambassador, is unlike anything I have seen in my professional career,\\\" he said. 9:26 a. m.  In his opening statement Ranking Member Devin Nunes continued to attack Democrats over the impeachment inquiry, calling the proceedings a \\\"kangaroo court\\\" and a \\\"spectacle\\\" intended to undermine the president. \\\"Whether the Democrats reap the political benefit they want from this impeachment remains to be seen.  But the damage they have done to this country will be long-lasting,\\\" he said. Nunes also filed another request to bring Republican witnesses for a day of hearings, repeating calls from the minority that they be able to question Hunter Biden and the whistleblower, among others.  Schiff his indicated he will not call those witnesses to testify. Nunes also pushed back on part of Hill's prepared opening statement, where she accused some committee members of denying Russia's efforts to interfere in American elections. Nunes held up the Intelligence Committee report on Russian election interference from Republicans on the committee and staff handed copies to Hill and Holmes.  The report authored by Republicans cleared President Trump of any collusion between his campaign and Russian actors. More background from ABC News' Ben Siegel: House Republicans also raised questions in the report about the intelligence community's findings that Russia sought to boost Trump and hurt Hillary Clinton in 2016.  Special counsel Bob Mueller would later testify to the House Judiciary Committee that Russia wanted Trump to win, and the leaders of the Senate Intelligence Committee have affirmed the same conclusion. Democrats said they refused to sign on to the report because they didn't find the GOP findings credible, and because Republicans failed to interview a number of witnesses. Holmes also said that while officials were making progress on anti-corruption efforts, commercial deals, and energy sector reforms with the Zelenskiy administration he did not see any improvements in Trump's view of Ukraine, seeming to undermine the Republican argument that the administration was focused on dealing with corruption. 9:13 a. m. Schiff continues by revisiting some of the details of Hill and Holmes' closed-door testimony. Hill testified she became concerned about the role of Rudy Giuliani, the president's personal lawyer, took in Ukraine policy, saying then-National Security Adviser John Bolton described Giuliani as “a hand grenade that is going to blow everybody up\\\" and said she clashed with EU Ambassador Gordon Sondland who she said told her the president put him in charge of Ukraine. \\\"In the coming days, Congress will determine what response is appropriate,\\\" Schiff said in his opening statement.   \\\"If the President abused his power and invited foreign interference in our elections, if he sought to condition, coerce, extort, or bribe a vulnerable ally into conducting investigations to aid his reelection campaign and did so by withholding official acts — a White House meeting or hundreds of millions of dollars of needed military aid — it will be up to us to decide, whether those acts are compatible with the office of the Presidency,\\\" Schiff said. 9:06 a. m.  House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff gavels the hearing into session. He begins his opening statement by reviewing what he said were the investigation President Donald Trump wanted. \\\"The first investigation was of a discredited conspiracy theory that Ukraine and not Russia was responsible for interfering in our 2016 election.   The second investigation was into the political rival Trump apparently feared most, Joe Biden,\\\" Schiff said. \\\"Trump sought to weaken Biden, and to refute the fact that his own election had been helped by a Russian hacking and dumping operation and Russian social media campaign directed by Vladimir Putin,\\\" he said. Hill will deliver her opening statement first, after Schiff and the top Republican on the committee, Rep.  Devin Nunes. Hill shared some of her personal backstory in her opening statement.  She became a U. S.  citizen in 2002 after emigrating from England.  Her ancestors fought in both World Wars and she said many of the men in her father's family were coal miners.  Her father wanted to move to the United States in the 1960s after coal mines closed in England but stayed to care for her grandmother until 2012.  Her mother still lives in England. \\\"While his dream of emigrating to America was thwarted, my father loved America, its culture, its history and its role as a beacon of hope in the world.  He always wanted someone in the family to make it to the United States,\\\" she said. In her career, Hill says, became a \\\"nonpartisan, nonpolitical national security professional\\\" focused on Europe and the former Soviet Union.  She says the turning point was when she attended the signing of a nuclear treaty between President Ronald Reagan met Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev in Moscow in 1987. 8:35 a. m. ABC News White House reporter Jordyn Phelps highlights that President Trump is very active on Twitter this morning in blasting the impeachment probe and expressing disbelief that his name has been associated with the “the ugly word, Impeachment. ”@realDonaldTrump: \\\"I never in my wildest dreams thought my name would in any way be associated with the ugly word, Impeachment!  The calls (Transcripts) were PERFECT, there was NOTHING said that was wrong.  No pressure on Ukraine.  Great corruption & dishonesty by Schiff on the other side! \\\"This isn’t the first time the president has let on just how much he’s bothered on a personal level by the impeachment inquiry, even as he also simultaneously strikes a defiant tone of confidence that the inquiry is actually helping him politically. Back on Oct.  12, the president said: “I never thought I’d see or hear that word with respect to me -- an ugly word, it means so much, it means horrible, horrible crimes and things, I can’t even believe it, it’s a witch hunt. ”8:30 a. m. Both Hill and Holmes have arrived on Capitol Hill. Hill's opening statement, obtained by ABC News ahead of the hearing, warns of the \\\"fictional narrative\\\" that Ukraine interfered in American elections and not Russia. The consensus among intelligence agencies and congressional investigators is that Russia has sought to interfere in American elections for decades and actively did so in 2016. “The unfortunate truth is that Russia was the foreign power that systematically attacked our democratic institutions in 2016.  This is the public conclusion of our intelligence agencies, confirmed in bipartisan Congressional reports.  It is beyond dispute, even if some of the underlying details must remain classified,\\\" Hill is expected to say in her opening statement. She's also expected to blast Republicans and other partisan figures who perpetuate misinformation about Ukraine, saying political divisions make it harder to combat the problem. \\\"I refuse to be part of an effort to legitimize an alternate narrative that the Ukrainian government is a U. S.  adversary, and that Ukraine—not Russia—attacked us in 2016,\\\" Hill will say. Russian President Vladimir Putin expressed relief at an event in Moscow Wednesday, saying \\\"thank God\\\" no one is accusing us of interfering in American elections anymore. \\\"Thank God, no one is accusing us of interfering in U. S.  elections anymore; now they're accusing Ukraine - well, let them sort it out among themselves.  But this factor of the domestic political struggle affects— still negatively affects-- Russian-American relations, I hope that this will someday end.  We are ready for this,\\\" he said, according to ABC News' Patrick Reevell in Moscow. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events\",\n  \"document_ocr\": \"abc\\nNEWS\\nDR.

Trump hails Kim Jong Un as 'great leader' at summitWith President Donald Trump in Vietnam this week, advocates are continuing calls for his administration to fully reverse moves to deport refugees who came to the U. S.  in the wake of the Vietnam War. The issue has left many in a state of uncertainty over the possibility of deportation and lawmakers joined activists on Capitol Hill Wednesday calling on the administration to stop what they call a targeting of Asian American immigrants. “The administration is clearly trying to deport as many immigrants as possible,” Democratic Rep.  Judy Chu of California told ABC News. The issue centers on the Trump administration’s reconsideration of a 2008 bilateral agreement between the U. S.  and Vietnam that effectively stopped deportation orders for Vietnamese nationals who arrived in America prior to 1995. Immigration court removal orders for Vietnamese nationals steadily declined throughout most of the Obama administration and have leveled off in recent years. A lawsuit from the nonprofit advocacy group Asian Americans Advancing Justice revealed the administration's wavering posture last year. The court challenge, brought against the Department of Homeland Security, relies in part on a 2001 Supreme Court ruling that prevents extended detention for immigrants whose country of origin will not accept their return. “It’s part of a larger practice and pattern that we have seen with this administration,\\\" said Phi Nguyen, one of the lawyers who brought the class action lawsuit.  \\\"There’s a lot of, I think, abuse of power. ”In court documents from April of last year, an Immigration and Customs Enforcement official acknowledged the agency’s efforts to remove Vietnamese nationals who had previous orders of removal. But in September, the same official said senior ICE officials had met with the Vietnamese government and determined they could not carry out the removals. “ICE has no arrests policy specific to particular nationalities,” ICE spokesperson Brendan Raedy said in response to questions from ABC News.  “ICE remains committed to directing its enforcement resources to those aliens posing the greatest risk to the safety and security of the United States. ”Concern over deportation orders has prompted action from within Vietnamese communities across the country.  In recent months, Vietnamese Americans rallied in Seattle, New Orleans and Orange County, California. “Our families came to America as war-torn refugees, after narrowly escaping the horrors of the Vietnam War,” said Matt Nguyen, a local community activist who participated in the Orange County rally and formerly worked on refugee rights for the U. S.  State Department.  “Trump’s new policy reopens old wounds and inflicts incredible pain on our community,” he said. The Vietnam embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The continuing battles pose additional strain for Trump's Republican Party after the traditionally conservative voting patterns of the Vietnamese American community were disrupted in the 2018 midterm elections. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events\",\n  \"document_ocr\": \"No More\\nDeportation\\nNo More\\nFamily Seperato\\nGerald Herbert/AP, FILE\\n\",\n  \"Category\": \"Insufficient_Text\"\n}, {\n  \"Id\": 34922,\n  \"claim_image\": \"http://pbs.twimg.com/media/D0bepkYWkAA1gTp.jpg?format=jpg&name=large\",\n  \"claim\": \"The President's former lawyer Michael Cohen testified that Donald Trump directed him to \\\"threaten\\\" Trump's high school, colleges and the College Board to not release his educational records https://t.co/dZvN91dBOW https://t.co/4gRZUOKoWA\",\n  \"claim_ocr\": \"OHIP SOMODEVILLAXEDUARDO MUNOZ ALVAREZ?GETTY IMAGES\\n\",\n  \"document_image\": \"http://pbs.twimg.com/media/D0bMOS8VYAElrGW.jpg?format=jpg&name=large\",\n  \"document\": \"Notable moments included a fight over claims of racism and partisan bickering.  Moments that mattered from Cohen's hearingMichael Cohen, a longtime confidante of the president, his former personal attorney and fixer, arrived on Capitol Hill on Wednesday to share publicly, for the first time, his side of the story. Cohen's fiery testimony, a written version of which was released to ABC News and other news outlets earlier, alleged that President Donald Trump is a \\\"racist,\\\" a \\\"conman\\\" and a \\\"cheat\\\" – and promised documents to back up Cohen's claims. Here are some of the notable moments from the hearing. In his closing remarks, Cohen said his loyalty to Trump \\\"cost him everything. \\\"\\\"I will not sit back, say nothing and allow him to do the same for the country,\\\" he said. He then ran down a list of policy decisions he's seen over the past two years and denounced them all, ticking through criticisms Trump often receives from the other side of the aisle.  Don't \\\"demonize those looking to America for a better life,\\\" Cohen said, and \\\"don't shut down the government before Christmas and New Years just to please your base. \\\"He maintained that he hoped the country would be better off with more of the truth, but warned that there were challenging times to come. \\\"I fear that if [Trump] loses the election in 2020, there will never be a peaceful transition of power,\\\" he said. Ranking member Rep.  Jim Jordan, the Republican from Ohio and a Trump ally who was sharply critical of Cohen throughout the testimony, closed with a warning that Cohen, who is going to prison in two months for charges that include lying to Congress, was not a credible witness. Democratic Rep.  Elijah Cummings, the chair of the committee, spoke last. \\\"I've sat here and I listened to all of this and it's very painful,\\\" he said.  \\\"One of the saddest parts of this whole thing is that some very innocent people are hurting too. \\\" Cohen grew emotional at the mention of his family. Cummings ended on a note of hope. \\\"Hopefully this portion of your destiny will lead to a better . . .  Michael Cohen, a better Donald Trump, a better United States of America, and a better world. \\\"In a moment that required no response from the witness, two members of Congress waded into contentious waters over allegations of racism. Tlaib, one of the last members of Congress to speak, began her time by making the point that Trump is not clear of allegations of being a racist because he had a black woman – Lynne Patton, an official at the Department of Housing and Urban Development who supports Trump and attended as Meadow's guest – as an employee. Tlaib continued: \\\"The fact that someone would even use a prop, a black woman, in this chamber, in this committee, is alone racist in itself. \\\"Meadows immediately objected, calling for her comments to be struck from the record and defending his record of civil rights advocacy.  \\\"My nieces and nephews are people of color.  Not many people know that.  You know that Mr.  Chairman,\\\" Meadows added. Tlaib reread her statement and clarified that she did not intend to call Meadows a racist.  \\\"As a person of color, that's how I felt at that moment and I wanted to express that.  I'm saying it is a racist act,\\\" she said. Cummings jumped in to mitigate the conflict between the freshman Democrat and the senior Republican, speaking as the chair of the committee, the son of sharecroppers, and -- a fact that he said surprises people -- as a very close friend of Meadows. \\\"I can see and feel your pain.  I feel it.  And I don't think Ms.  Tlaib intended to cause you that -- that kind of pain and that kind of frustration. \\\"Questions about his family, who Cohen said he caused \\\"tremendous, tremendous pain,\\\" have led to some of the more emotional moments of his testimony. But there has also been combative frustration – when Republican Rep.  Jim Jordan accused him of not owning up to his crimes, Cohen adamantly pushed back. \\\"Shame on you, Mr.  Jordan.  That's not what I said.  Shame on you,\\\" he said. Here's a look at the wave of emotions during hours of testimony before members of Congress. Democratic Rep.  Brenda Lawrence told Cohen Wednesday that she didn't doubt his stories about racist comments made privately by Trump. \\\"I just want to put on the record as being a black American and having endured the public comments of racism from the sitting president, as being a black person, I can only imagine what's being said in private,\\\" Lawrence said.  The Michigan congresswoman made history in 2001 when she became the first African American and the first woman to be elected the mayor of Southfield, Michigan. Lawrence also called out Republicans for bringing Lynne Patton, an official at the Department of Housing and Urban Affairs, as an apparent attempt at rebutting Cohen's claim that Trump is \\\"racist. \\\" Patton has defended Trump in the past. \\\"To prop up one member of our entire race of black people and say that that nullifies that is totally insulting,\\\" Lawrence said.  \\\"And in this environment of expecting a president to be inclusive, and to look at his administration, speaks volume,\\\" she added, pointing to the lack of diversity in Trump's Cabinet, compared to past presidents. Stormy Daniels, the adult film star who alleged she had an affair with Trump and was kept quiet about it through a $130,000 payment, once detailed the threats of bankruptcy – and worse, she said – she was facing from Cohen. But on Wednesday, Daniels said she was \\\"proud\\\" of the man who once paid her for her silence.  In a statement to ABC News and others, she spoke directly to Cohen. \\\"Michael, I’m proud of you for finally beginning to tell the truth about what you did, and trying to repair some of the harm you have caused.  I can hear the pain and regret you feel for betraying your family and your country.  My heart goes out to you and your family,\\\" said Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford. Daniels went on to say she empathized with him but made it clear that he contributed to the fear she felt then – and he feels now. \\\"You spoke about how the president and his attorney put you and your family in danger by calling you a liar and a rat and disparaging you in public.  I understand your fear, Michael.  I have a family too.  Do you believe now that when you and the president called me a liar when you were his attorney and you insulted me, threatened to bankrupt me and worse, that you put me and my family in danger? \\\" Daniels said in a statement.  \\\"I remember the fear you feel.  I still feel it.  Thank you for having the courage, at long last, to begin to tell the truth.  I hope that someday soon your family and mine can both leave this nightmare behind. \\\"Earlier in his testimony, Cohen described a conversation that seemingly revealed new details about the way Daniels' claims were handled.  (Daniels called Cohen's testimony important and said she didn't want to take the focus away from it, but to briefly address him). Cohen said Trump called him in February of last year to coordinate public messaging about hush money payments, instructing Cohen to say “he was not knowledgeable of the reimbursements and he wasn't knowledgeable of my actions,” Cohen said. While many congressional hearings and confirmations in the past few months have doubled as 2020 campaign platforms, the House Oversight and Reform Committee is relatively devoid of presidential candidates. But in today's politics, the next election is never far. As Cohen testified, Democratic Sen.  Elizabeth Warren – one of the first 2020 candidates to declare a bid – sent out a promise to supporters: If she's elected, \\\"there will be no pardons for anyone implicated in these investigations. \\\"Warren promised no pardons or commutations for anyone charged in the Mueller investigation, anyone implicated in a federal criminal investigation related to Trump, and \\\"no pardon or commutation for Donald Trump himself. \\\"About two hours into a hearing filled with blatant partisan divide, quips from all sides and testy one-liners – \\\"The record reflects that you're not a nice guy,\\\" Republican Rep.  Mark Meadows of North Carolina told Cohen – the president's former fixer called members of Congress out for the combative behavior in an unusual way: by taking responsibility for it. \\\"It's that sort of behavior that I'm responsible for.  I'm responsible for your silliness because I did the same thing that you're doing now for ten years,\\\" Cohen said. \\\"I protected Mr.  Trump for ten years,\\\" Cohen said. Cohen warned Republicans, who he saw as defending the president, to take note of his current position: \\\"The more people that follow Mr.  Trump as I did, blindly, are going to suffer the same consequences that I'm suffering. \\\"Just as Cohen stepped away from the cameras for his first break, the one-and-only Anthony Scaramucci piped up with his reaction to the beginning of the testimony. Scaramucci, who spent 11 days as Trump's communication chief before a sharp exit, had a message for D. C. : it \\\"sucks,\\\" he said. It wasn't clear who, exactly, Scaramucci was referring to. The president, who has a 12-hour time difference while in Vietnam, has yet to chime in on the hearing – but did retweet himself at the beginning of the testimony. \\\"He is lying in order to reduce his prison time,\\\" Trump tweeted. Cohen’s 30-minute opening statement was rife with emotion — a detailed thread of the lies and offensive rhetoric then-candidate and now-President Trump allegedly used, interlaced with Cohen’s own admission that he continued, again and again, to participate in acts he knew were wrong, and at times, unlawful. One of those moments, Cohen said, now holds great irony. \\\"Mr.  Trump tasked me to handle the negative press surrounding his medical deferment from the Vietnam draft,\\\" Cohen said.  \\\"Mr.  Trump claimed it was because of a bone spur.  But when I asked for medical records, he gave me none and said that there was no surgery.  He told me not to answer the specific questions by reporters, but rather offer simply the fact that he received a medical deferment.  He finished the conversation with the following comment, 'you think I'm stupid, I'm not going to Vietnam. '\\\"\\\"And I find it ironic, Mr.  President, that you are in Vietnam right now,\\\" Cohen said. Cohen choked up when he spoke about his wife, Laura, and his nearly-grown children, Sami and Jake, who he said he would do anything to protect. \\\"As my father said countless times throughout my childhood, you, my wife, and you, my children, are the air that I breathe,\\\" Cohen said. Cohen detailed moments he regretted — like lying to first lady Melania Trump allegedly at the president’s direction, he said. “He asked me to pay off an adult film star with whom he had an affair and to lie about it to his wife, which I did.  And lying to the First Lady is one of my biggest regrets, because she is a kind, good person, and I respect her greatly.  And she did not deserve that,” Cohen said. Cohen cataloged times he picked up on what he claims were developments for a now-infamous Trump Tower meeting — including a chat between the president and his son, Don Jr. , who Trump allegedly said \\\"had the worst judgment of anyone in the world,\\\" according to Cohen. “What struck me as I look back and thought about the exchange between Don Jr.  and his father was, first, that Mr.  Trump had frequently told me and others that his son Don Jr.  had the worst judgment of anyone in the world, and also that Don Jr.  would never set up any meeting of significance alone, and certainly not without checking with his father,” Cohen said. “I also knew that nothing went on in Trump World, especially the campaign, without Mr.  Trump's knowledge and approval.  So I concluded that Don Jr.  was referring to that June 2016 trump tower meeting about dirt on Hillary with the Russian representatives when he walked behind his dad's desk that day,” Cohen said. Cohen closed by owning up to his past and promising not to lie, again, before members of Congress. “For those who question my motives for being here today, I understand,” Cohen said. “I have lied, but I am not a liar.  I have done bad things, but I am not a bad man.  I have fixed things, but I am no longer your fixer, Mr.  Trump.  And I am going to prison and have shattered the safety and security that I tried so hard to provide for my family,” Cohen said. A few hours before the long-anticipated hearing got underway, Merriam Webster — which has frequently spell-checked the president — offered this Tweet:\\\"Word of the Day?  Grift — to obtain money illicitly. \\\"And Dictionary. com said variations of the word \\\"collusion\\\" were trending. Here's what a top dictionary editor told ABC News in a recent story on the uptick of dictionaries chiming in during key political moments:“Paying attention to the spelling and meaning of words is a way of respecting linguistic facts, which is a requirement for serious, professional, published writing,” Peter Sokolowski, editor-at-large of Merriam-Webster, told ABC News.  \\\"Before we can come to a consensus on the meaning of ideas, we need to come to a consensus on the meaning of the words that express those ideas,\\\" he added. The hearing kicked off with a move by Republicans, led by Meadows, a Trump ally, to postpone the hearing because Cohen’s testimony was not delivered 24-hours ahead of time – a procedural sticking point that Republicans said proved Cohen wasn't following the rules. \\\"It was an intentional effort by this witness and his advisors to once again show his disdain for this body,\\\" Meadows said. Democrats, who acknowledged Cohen's scarred history and upcoming prison time, sought to give Cohen a platform to share his side of the story with the country.  Republicans repeatedly called on Cohen's history of lying to Congress – one of the crimes he is going to prison for – as proof that he could not be taken at his word. The hearing continued after a vote, which fell along party lines and gave the majority to the Democrats. \\\"You've made it clear that you do not want the American people to hear what Mr.  Cohen has to say, but the American people have a right to hear him.  So we're going to proceed.  The American people can judge his credibility for themselves,\\\" Democratic Chairman Rep.  Elijah Cummings said. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events\",\n  \"document_ocr\": \"abc\\nNEWS\\nMR. GOSAR\\nMR. AMASH\\nMR. JORDAN\\nCON\\nMR GOMEZ\\nMR.

According to official details, India abstained from voting together with 13 other member nations of the grouping.  China and Russia were among those voting in favour. \\\"The Human Rights Council this afternoon adopted a resolution on ensuring respect for international human rights law and international humanitarian law in the occupied Palestinian territory, including East Jerusalem, and in Israel,\\\" the UN body said in a statement.

The special session of the Council was called to discuss the “grave human rights situation\\\" in the Palestinian territory including East Jerusalem. India's permanent representative to the UN in Geneva Indra Mani Pandey said at the special session that New Delhi welcomes the diplomatic efforts of the international community and regional countries that have resulted in bringing ceasefire between Israel and armed groups in Gaza. \\\"India calls on all parties to show extreme restraint, desist from actions that aggravate tensions and refrain from any further attempts to unilaterally change the existing status-quo, including in East Jerusalem and its neighbourhoods,\\\" he said. In a statement, Pandey also expressed concern at the continuing violence in Jerusalem, especially at Haram Al Sharif and other Palestinian territories. \\\"We remain concerned about the continuing violence in Jerusalem, especially at Haram Al Sharif/Temple Mount and other Palestinian territories, and about the possible eviction process in Sheikh Jarrah and Silwan neighbourhoods in East Jerusalem,\\\" he said. Pandey said the indiscriminate rocket firings from Gaza targeting the civilian population in Israel, and the retaliatory airstrikes into Gaza have caused immense sufferings. \\\"We deeply mourn the loss of civilian lives resulting from the violence, and urge the international community's immediate attention to providing humanitarian assistance to the Palestinian civilian population, particularly in Gaza,\\\" he said. \\\"India continues to provide developmental and humanitarian assistance to the Palestinian Authority, including COVID-19 related assistance, bilaterally, and through our dedicated contribution to the UN,\\\" he added. Both Israel and Hamas agreed on a ceasefire that has come into effect on last Friday after 11 days of intense fighting in which around 230 people were killed in Gaza and 12 in Israel. Pandey said India was firmly convinced that dialogue remains the only viable option that can effectively address the issues confronting the region and its people. \\\"Recent developments have once again underscored the need for immediate resumption of dialogue between Israel and Palestine, aimed at realising the establishment of two States living side by side in peace within secure and recognised borders,\\\" he said.  \",\n  \"document_ocr\": \"SATUMEW JAYATHE\\nHIGH COURT OF KERALA\\n\",\n  \"Category\": \"Insufficient_Text\"\n}, {\n  \"Id\": 34924,\n  \"claim_image\": \"http://pbs.twimg.com/media/Edyl2IAUwAAa8jS.jpg?format=jpg&name=large\",\n  \"claim\": \"Floods ravage Bihar, Assam; rain causes landslips in Sikkim\\n\\nhttps://t.co/PJtVjEX3QI https://t.co/iyD6bD9CM6\",\n  \"claim_ocr\": \"\",\n  \"document_image\": \"http://pbs.twimg.com/media/EdaDX2LUcAA2lQ6.jpg?format=jpg&name=large\",\n  \"document\": \"Floods caused due to heavy rainfall continue to wreak havoc in districts of Assam and Bihar while incessant rainfall in remote villages of North Sikkim has caused landslides cutting them off from other parts of the state.

In Raha area of Nagaon district of Assam, several schools, water supply project and other government buildings have been submerged in the floodwaters, officials said.  Meanwhile, the Indian Air Force (IAF) choppers on Saturday carried out relief operations in three of Bihar’s worst affected districts—Darbhanga, Gopalganj and East Champaran.  Besides the three major districts like Gopalganj, East Champaran and Darbhanga, Sitamarhi, Sheohar, Supaul, Kishanganj, Muzaffarpur, West Champaran and Khagaria are also facing the devastation due to floods of various scales, officials said. The Bihar Disaster Management Department Authority (BDMDA) principal secretary Pratyaya Amrit on Saturday said that around 10 lakh people have been affected due to the floods in the state and the Darbhanga district is the worst affected.  He added that there has been a slight reduction in the water levels across the state and around one lakh people have been evacuated. Deputy chief minister Sushil Modi said that each flood-affected person would be given Rs 6,000 each as relief from the government.  “Compensation for loss of standing crops would be announced after the assessment.  Farmers would be provided seeds for alternative crops to offset the losses,” said Modi. Over half a dozen monuments, heritage sites and ancient temples, located in flood affected districts in northern part of the state, have been inundated by flood water.  The Ashokan pillar at Lauria in West Champaran, the Buddhist stupa at Kesaria in East Champaran and the remains of the fortification of ancient ruler Raja Bali at Balirajgarh in Madhubani district have been inundated, officials said.  HS Naik, superintending archaeologist of the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), Patna circle, said the ASI has taken the matter seriously.  “Soon after the flood water recedes from Champaran and Kesaria stupa site, we will send our engineer to assess the damage and also to draft the strategies to keep the monuments and sites safe,” he said.  Meteorologist Ravindra Kumar said, “Bihar is likely to receive heavy rains after July 26.  Widespread rain with greater intensity is likely to hit entire Bihar on July 27 and 28.  A yellow category warning for heavy to very heavy rain coupled with thunderstorm and lightning has been issued for North Bihar and several parts of south-western districts. ”Separately, an Indian Air Force (IAF) helicopter on Saturday airlifted essential commodities for the people of two remote villages in North Sikkim, which are cut off from other parts of the state due to landslides, an official release said. The MI-17 helicopter carried out three sorties and dropped essential supplies comprising 100 bags of rice weighing 50 quintals each, 550 litres of cooking oil, 1. 5 quintals of salt, 100 packets of candles and matches and medicines among others for the people of Sakyong and Pentong villages of North Sikkim, the release said. The two villages are cut-off from the nearest town Dzongu since July 10 last as multiple landslides had washed off roads and bridges connecting these villages due to incessant rainfall.

Moments that mattered from Cohen's hearingMichael Cohen, a longtime confidante of the president, his former personal attorney and fixer, arrived on Capitol Hill on Wednesday to share publicly, for the first time, his side of the story. Cohen's fiery testimony, a written version of which was released to ABC News and other news outlets earlier, alleged that President Donald Trump is a \\\"racist,\\\" a \\\"conman\\\" and a \\\"cheat\\\" – and promised documents to back up Cohen's claims. Here are some of the notable moments from the hearing. In his closing remarks, Cohen said his loyalty to Trump \\\"cost him everything. \\\"\\\"I will not sit back, say nothing and allow him to do the same for the country,\\\" he said. He then ran down a list of policy decisions he's seen over the past two years and denounced them all, ticking through criticisms Trump often receives from the other side of the aisle.  Don't \\\"demonize those looking to America for a better life,\\\" Cohen said, and \\\"don't shut down the government before Christmas and New Years just to please your base. \\\"He maintained that he hoped the country would be better off with more of the truth, but warned that there were challenging times to come. \\\"I fear that if [Trump] loses the election in 2020, there will never be a peaceful transition of power,\\\" he said. Ranking member Rep.  Jim Jordan, the Republican from Ohio and a Trump ally who was sharply critical of Cohen throughout the testimony, closed with a warning that Cohen, who is going to prison in two months for charges that include lying to Congress, was not a credible witness. Democratic Rep.  Elijah Cummings, the chair of the committee, spoke last. \\\"I've sat here and I listened to all of this and it's very painful,\\\" he said.  \\\"One of the saddest parts of this whole thing is that some very innocent people are hurting too. \\\" Cohen grew emotional at the mention of his family. Cummings ended on a note of hope. \\\"Hopefully this portion of your destiny will lead to a better . . .  Michael Cohen, a better Donald Trump, a better United States of America, and a better world. \\\"In a moment that required no response from the witness, two members of Congress waded into contentious waters over allegations of racism. Tlaib, one of the last members of Congress to speak, began her time by making the point that Trump is not clear of allegations of being a racist because he had a black woman – Lynne Patton, an official at the Department of Housing and Urban Development who supports Trump and attended as Meadow's guest – as an employee. Tlaib continued: \\\"The fact that someone would even use a prop, a black woman, in this chamber, in this committee, is alone racist in itself. \\\"Meadows immediately objected, calling for her comments to be struck from the record and defending his record of civil rights advocacy.  \\\"My nieces and nephews are people of color.  Not many people know that.  You know that Mr.  Chairman,\\\" Meadows added. Tlaib reread her statement and clarified that she did not intend to call Meadows a racist.  \\\"As a person of color, that's how I felt at that moment and I wanted to express that.  I'm saying it is a racist act,\\\" she said. Cummings jumped in to mitigate the conflict between the freshman Democrat and the senior Republican, speaking as the chair of the committee, the son of sharecroppers, and -- a fact that he said surprises people -- as a very close friend of Meadows. \\\"I can see and feel your pain.  I feel it.  And I don't think Ms.  Tlaib intended to cause you that -- that kind of pain and that kind of frustration. \\\"Questions about his family, who Cohen said he caused \\\"tremendous, tremendous pain,\\\" have led to some of the more emotional moments of his testimony. But there has also been combative frustration – when Republican Rep.  Jim Jordan accused him of not owning up to his crimes, Cohen adamantly pushed back. \\\"Shame on you, Mr.  Jordan.  That's not what I said.  Shame on you,\\\" he said. Here's a look at the wave of emotions during hours of testimony before members of Congress. Democratic Rep.  Brenda Lawrence told Cohen Wednesday that she didn't doubt his stories about racist comments made privately by Trump. \\\"I just want to put on the record as being a black American and having endured the public comments of racism from the sitting president, as being a black person, I can only imagine what's being said in private,\\\" Lawrence said.  The Michigan congresswoman made history in 2001 when she became the first African American and the first woman to be elected the mayor of Southfield, Michigan. Lawrence also called out Republicans for bringing Lynne Patton, an official at the Department of Housing and Urban Affairs, as an apparent attempt at rebutting Cohen's claim that Trump is \\\"racist. \\\" Patton has defended Trump in the past. \\\"To prop up one member of our entire race of black people and say that that nullifies that is totally insulting,\\\" Lawrence said.  \\\"And in this environment of expecting a president to be inclusive, and to look at his administration, speaks volume,\\\" she added, pointing to the lack of diversity in Trump's Cabinet, compared to past presidents. Stormy Daniels, the adult film star who alleged she had an affair with Trump and was kept quiet about it through a $130,000 payment, once detailed the threats of bankruptcy – and worse, she said – she was facing from Cohen. But on Wednesday, Daniels said she was \\\"proud\\\" of the man who once paid her for her silence.  In a statement to ABC News and others, she spoke directly to Cohen. \\\"Michael, I’m proud of you for finally beginning to tell the truth about what you did, and trying to repair some of the harm you have caused.  I can hear the pain and regret you feel for betraying your family and your country.  My heart goes out to you and your family,\\\" said Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford. Daniels went on to say she empathized with him but made it clear that he contributed to the fear she felt then – and he feels now. \\\"You spoke about how the president and his attorney put you and your family in danger by calling you a liar and a rat and disparaging you in public.  I understand your fear, Michael.  I have a family too.  Do you believe now that when you and the president called me a liar when you were his attorney and you insulted me, threatened to bankrupt me and worse, that you put me and my family in danger? \\\" Daniels said in a statement.  \\\"I remember the fear you feel.  I still feel it.  Thank you for having the courage, at long last, to begin to tell the truth.  I hope that someday soon your family and mine can both leave this nightmare behind. \\\"Earlier in his testimony, Cohen described a conversation that seemingly revealed new details about the way Daniels' claims were handled.  (Daniels called Cohen's testimony important and said she didn't want to take the focus away from it, but to briefly address him). Cohen said Trump called him in February of last year to coordinate public messaging about hush money payments, instructing Cohen to say “he was not knowledgeable of the reimbursements and he wasn't knowledgeable of my actions,” Cohen said. While many congressional hearings and confirmations in the past few months have doubled as 2020 campaign platforms, the House Oversight and Reform Committee is relatively devoid of presidential candidates. But in today's politics, the next election is never far. As Cohen testified, Democratic Sen.  Elizabeth Warren – one of the first 2020 candidates to declare a bid – sent out a promise to supporters: If she's elected, \\\"there will be no pardons for anyone implicated in these investigations. \\\"Warren promised no pardons or commutations for anyone charged in the Mueller investigation, anyone implicated in a federal criminal investigation related to Trump, and \\\"no pardon or commutation for Donald Trump himself. \\\"About two hours into a hearing filled with blatant partisan divide, quips from all sides and testy one-liners – \\\"The record reflects that you're not a nice guy,\\\" Republican Rep.  Mark Meadows of North Carolina told Cohen – the president's former fixer called members of Congress out for the combative behavior in an unusual way: by taking responsibility for it. \\\"It's that sort of behavior that I'm responsible for.  I'm responsible for your silliness because I did the same thing that you're doing now for ten years,\\\" Cohen said. \\\"I protected Mr.  Trump for ten years,\\\" Cohen said. Cohen warned Republicans, who he saw as defending the president, to take note of his current position: \\\"The more people that follow Mr.  Trump as I did, blindly, are going to suffer the same consequences that I'm suffering. \\\"Just as Cohen stepped away from the cameras for his first break, the one-and-only Anthony Scaramucci piped up with his reaction to the beginning of the testimony. Scaramucci, who spent 11 days as Trump's communication chief before a sharp exit, had a message for D. C. : it \\\"sucks,\\\" he said. It wasn't clear who, exactly, Scaramucci was referring to. The president, who has a 12-hour time difference while in Vietnam, has yet to chime in on the hearing – but did retweet himself at the beginning of the testimony. \\\"He is lying in order to reduce his prison time,\\\" Trump tweeted. Cohen’s 30-minute opening statement was rife with emotion — a detailed thread of the lies and offensive rhetoric then-candidate and now-President Trump allegedly used, interlaced with Cohen’s own admission that he continued, again and again, to participate in acts he knew were wrong, and at times, unlawful. One of those moments, Cohen said, now holds great irony. \\\"Mr.  Trump tasked me to handle the negative press surrounding his medical deferment from the Vietnam draft,\\\" Cohen said.  \\\"Mr.  Trump claimed it was because of a bone spur.  But when I asked for medical records, he gave me none and said that there was no surgery.  He told me not to answer the specific questions by reporters, but rather offer simply the fact that he received a medical deferment.  He finished the conversation with the following comment, 'you think I'm stupid, I'm not going to Vietnam. '\\\"\\\"And I find it ironic, Mr.  President, that you are in Vietnam right now,\\\" Cohen said. Cohen choked up when he spoke about his wife, Laura, and his nearly-grown children, Sami and Jake, who he said he would do anything to protect. \\\"As my father said countless times throughout my childhood, you, my wife, and you, my children, are the air that I breathe,\\\" Cohen said. Cohen detailed moments he regretted — like lying to first lady Melania Trump allegedly at the president’s direction, he said. “He asked me to pay off an adult film star with whom he had an affair and to lie about it to his wife, which I did.  And lying to the First Lady is one of my biggest regrets, because she is a kind, good person, and I respect her greatly.  And she did not deserve that,” Cohen said. Cohen cataloged times he picked up on what he claims were developments for a now-infamous Trump Tower meeting — including a chat between the president and his son, Don Jr. , who Trump allegedly said \\\"had the worst judgment of anyone in the world,\\\" according to Cohen. “What struck me as I look back and thought about the exchange between Don Jr.  and his father was, first, that Mr.  Trump had frequently told me and others that his son Don Jr.  had the worst judgment of anyone in the world, and also that Don Jr.  would never set up any meeting of significance alone, and certainly not without checking with his father,” Cohen said. “I also knew that nothing went on in Trump World, especially the campaign, without Mr.  Trump's knowledge and approval.  So I concluded that Don Jr.  was referring to that June 2016 trump tower meeting about dirt on Hillary with the Russian representatives when he walked behind his dad's desk that day,” Cohen said. Cohen closed by owning up to his past and promising not to lie, again, before members of Congress. “For those who question my motives for being here today, I understand,” Cohen said. “I have lied, but I am not a liar.  I have done bad things, but I am not a bad man.  I have fixed things, but I am no longer your fixer, Mr.  Trump.  And I am going to prison and have shattered the safety and security that I tried so hard to provide for my family,” Cohen said. A few hours before the long-anticipated hearing got underway, Merriam Webster — which has frequently spell-checked the president — offered this Tweet:\\\"Word of the Day?  Grift — to obtain money illicitly. \\\"And Dictionary. com said variations of the word \\\"collusion\\\" were trending. Here's what a top dictionary editor told ABC News in a recent story on the uptick of dictionaries chiming in during key political moments:“Paying attention to the spelling and meaning of words is a way of respecting linguistic facts, which is a requirement for serious, professional, published writing,” Peter Sokolowski, editor-at-large of Merriam-Webster, told ABC News.  \\\"Before we can come to a consensus on the meaning of ideas, we need to come to a consensus on the meaning of the words that express those ideas,\\\" he added. The hearing kicked off with a move by Republicans, led by Meadows, a Trump ally, to postpone the hearing because Cohen’s testimony was not delivered 24-hours ahead of time – a procedural sticking point that Republicans said proved Cohen wasn't following the rules. \\\"It was an intentional effort by this witness and his advisors to once again show his disdain for this body,\\\" Meadows said. Democrats, who acknowledged Cohen's scarred history and upcoming prison time, sought to give Cohen a platform to share his side of the story with the country.  Republicans repeatedly called on Cohen's history of lying to Congress – one of the crimes he is going to prison for – as proof that he could not be taken at his word. The hearing continued after a vote, which fell along party lines and gave the majority to the Democrats. \\\"You've made it clear that you do not want the American people to hear what Mr.  Cohen has to say, but the American people have a right to hear him.  So we're going to proceed.  The American people can judge his credibility for themselves,\\\" Democratic Chairman Rep.  Elijah Cummings said. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events\",\n  \"document_ocr\": \"abc\\nNEWS\\n\",\n  \"Category\": \"Insufficient_Text\"\n}, {\n  \"Id\": 34928,\n  \"claim_image\": \"http://pbs.twimg.com/media/Ed-cPR-UcAEBk0p.png?format=jpg&name=large\",\n  \"claim\": \"#COVID19 | Least active cases since June 1 in Delhi, 42% more beds than a month ago\\n\\n(report by @AnonnaDutt)  \\n\\nhttps://t.co/ep82ZArFbl https://t.co/qjinzGHR8r\",\n  \"claim_ocr\": \"\",\n  \"document_image\": \"http://pbs.twimg.com/media/EajlaWpUwAA44Tt.jpg?format=jpg&name=large\",\n  \"document\": \" The national capital now has a little less than 11,000 active cases of Covid-19, a number that is the lowest since June 1, according to data from Sunday that also shows how Delhi now has the 42% more beds than it had a month ago, suggesting it was amply prepared in case of a resurgence of cases.  According data released by the Delhi government in the past 45 days, the 10,994 active cases as on Sunday is roughly two-fifths of what it was on June 26 (27,657).  Click here for full Covid-19 coverageOn that day a month ago, the capital was in the middle of what is now believed to be a peak since surmounted.  The number of new cases on June 26 was 3,460 and they represented 16% of those tested on that day, a number that is also known as the test positivity rate.  On Sunday, the positivity rate was 5. 32%. Monday’s health bulletin released by the Delhi government also showed that less than a fifth of the hospital beds earmarked for treatment of Covid-19 patients was being utilised, with only 2,835 people being shown as hospitalised.  Also read: Global recoveries hit 10 million even as Covid-19 rages onThe city currently has 15,451 beds earmarked for Covid-19 in various government, private and makeshift field hospitals.  Of these, 2,095 beds are intensive care units, which had a 36% occupancy as on Monday evening, according to the Delhi Corona App.  The 2,835 beds account for 18. 35% of the state’s capacity, a number that is well under the 33% targeted occupancy rate by the Delhi government.  Last week, health minister Satyendar Jain said the government’s plan was to ensure that the city had thrice the number of hospital beds as active infections ready for surge preparedness.  “We cannot decide what to do based on a seven or 10 days’ trend.  Today, we are getting just over a 1,000 cases a day, but we do not know whether the numbers would remain there.  We are comfortable at the moment; if we scale down and then the cases start rising again, what will we do?  Scaling back up is easier said than done.  So, we need to wait and watch,” he said.  According to senior officials from Delhi’s health department, the decision is likely to come after the second round of sero-surveillance that is scheduled to be carried out between August 1 and 5.  “There is a meeting at the end of the week, where the issue of scaling back of preparations is likely to be taken up.  However, a final decision will only come by mid-August after the second round of sero-surveillance.  If the sero-surveillance shows that we are moving towards herd immunity then it will give people as well as the government some assurance,” the official, who asked not to be named, said.  A serological survey involves randomised sampling of people from whom blood is collected to check for antibodies to the Sars-Cov-2, which would indicate how many people may have been infected and silently recovered – and thus immune to the disease for the time being.  Also read: Delhi’s recovery road, as seen in Sunday numbersDelhi’s first round of sero-surveillance, for which around 22,000 samples were collected between June 27 and July 5, found that almost 23% of the city’s residents had antibodies.  Herd immunity is the level of immunity prevalence that causes an outbreak to die out as the virus fails to find enough new vulnerable hosts.  Doctors have flagged the low occupancy in hospitals as a factor that could be hitting health care facilities for people with diseases other than Covid-19. “Lok Nayak and GTB hospitals, both of which have been converted into Covid treatment facilities, are the biggest hospitals under the Delhi government catering to thousands of patients.  Right now, both remain under-utilised and the patients undergoing treatment at these hospitals continue to await their turn.  The government needs to maintain a buffer of beds in case there is a surge in Covid cases again, but they should start looking at moving towards normal,” said a doctor from 2,000-bed Lok Nayak hospital, Delhi’s biggest treatment Covid-19 centre, while asking not to be named The drop in number of hospitalisations has been in tandem with a fall in the number of new cases.  On Monday, Delhi recorded just 613 new cases of Covid-19, lowest since May 26.  The number is lower due to fewer tests being done over the weekend but the proportion of tests that turned positive – around 5. 3% -- was consistent with what has been seen over the past week.  The average positivity rate – the percentage of people who test positive among those tested – has reduced to 6. 24% in the week ending on July 26, as compared to 7. 61% the week before, and 8. 96 the week before that.  Dr Abhishek Shankar, assistant professor of oncology at Lady Hardinge Medical College, said that there will be an “adverse and irreversible impact” on cancer treatment of about 1. 5 million patients.  “On average, treatment for cancer lasts anywhere between three to fifteen months.  As per ICMR data, India’s annual cancer burden is about 15 lakh people.  With the lockdown and all non-Covid-19 services being hampered March onwards, the treatment of all these people would have suffered.  The treatment of Covid and other ailments should not have been mutually exclusive, but if you see an institute like National Cancer Centre has been completely converted for treatment of Covid-19.  Plus, if there are Covid-19 patients in a hospital, immunocompromised cancer patients would understandably want to stay away. ” \",\n  \"document_ocr\": \"ONY\\nANI\\nGREEN LCUNGE\\nGREEN LOUNGE\\nBANQUETS\\n\",\n  \"Category\": \"Insufficient_Text\"\n}, {\n  \"Id\": 34929,\n  \"claim_image\": \"http://pbs.twimg.com/media/D2cqwXfWsAIxkaI.jpg?format=jpg&name=large\",\n  \"claim\": \"Attorney General William Barr has submitted to Congress his summary of the main conclusions from special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation. https://t.co/jJ7I8L3jyn https://t.co/Fg4J6unrHj\",\n  \"claim_ocr\": \"JUSTICE\\nNO\\n\",\n  \"document_image\": \"http://pbs.twimg.com/media/D2c6qlqXcAA8Sv9.jpg?format=jpg&name=large\",\n  \"document\": \"The report doesn't conclude Trump committed a crime and doesn't exonerate him.

In both circumstances, the “Special Counsel did not find that the Trump campaign, or anyone associated with it, conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in these efforts. ”The special counsel’s office made no conclusion on the matter of possible obstruction of justice by President Donald Trump. \\\"The Special Counsel, therefore, did not draw a conclusion – one way or the other – as to whether the examined conduct constituted obstruction,\\\" the letter read.  \\\"Instead, for each of the relevant actions investigated, the report sets out 'difficult issues' of law and fact concerning whether the President's actions and intent could be viewed as obstruction. \\\"In his communique to lawmakers, Barr underscored that the special counsel states that “while this report does not conclude that the president committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him. ”While Mueller’s report did not reach a conclusion as to whether obstruction of justice occurred, Attorney General Barr’s letter said he determined a case for obstruction was not warranted. “In cataloging the President’s actions many of which took place in public view, the report identities no actions that, in our judgment, constitute obstructive conduct, had a nexus to a pending or contemplated proceeding, and were done with corrupt intent, each of which, under the Department's principles of federal prosecution guiding charging decisions, would need to be proven beyond a reasonable doubt to establish an obstruction-of-justice offense. \\\"Barr said his intent is to release as much as possible but there are grand jury secrecy concerns with some portions. The White House celebrated the news, with President Donald Trump hailing the report on Twitter and, later in comments to reporters, as an \\\"exoneration. \\\"\\\"This was an illegal takedown that failed and hopefully, someone is going to be looking at the other side,\\\" Trump told reporters on Sunday. He tweeted: \\\"No Collusion, No Obstruction, Complete and Total EXONERATION.  KEEP AMERICA GREAT! \\\"\\\"The Special Counsel did not find any collusion and did not find any obstruction,\\\" White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said in a statement.  \\\"Attorney General Barr and Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein further determined there was no obstruction.  The findings of the Department of Justice are a total and complete exoneration of the President of the United States. ”Jay Sekulow, one of President Trump’s lawyers, told ABC News chief anchor George Stephanopoulos that the report was a \\\"complete win for the president and the American people. \\\"\\\"Not just a win. \\\" Sekulow said.  \\\"The entire basis upon which this inquiry was instituted was a concern over collusion between the Russian government and the trump campaign, Bob Mueller and the Department of Justice could not be clearer.  To have the obstruction issue even as a viable one, which it was not, there would have to be an underlying crime, which there wasn't. \\\"House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler, D-N. Y. , questioned the timing of the letter tweeting \\\"Special Counsel Mueller worked for 22 months to determine the extent to which President Trump obstructed justice.  Attorney General Barr took 2 days to tell the American people that while the President is not exonerated, there will be no action by DOJ. \\\" He later tweeted that \\\"in light of the very concerning discrepancies and final decision making at the Justice Department following the Special Counsel report,\\\" the House Judiciary Committee will be calling Barr in to testify in the near future. In his letter to members of Congress on Sunday, Barr described the breadth of the special counsel’s extensive and exhaustive probe.  Mueller’s 19 prosecutors and 40 FBI agents issued more than 2,800 subpoenas, executed nearly 500 search warrants, and interviewed approximately 500 witnesses, Barr wrote, the results of which amounted to 37 indictments and six guilty pleas to date. The news comes amid Democrats continued calls for the full release of the findings. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, in a joint letter, seemed to sum up the sentiment of many congressional Democrats in saying that Barr's letter \\\"raises as many questions as it answers\\\" and that Congress \\\"requires the full report and the underlying documents. \\\"\\\"The fact that Special Counsel Mueller’s report does not exonerate the president on a charge as serious as obstruction of justice demonstrates how urgent it is that the full report and underlying documentation be made public without any further delay,\\\" they wrote.  \\\"Given Mr.  Barr’s public record of bias against the Special Counsel’s inquiry, he is not a neutral observer and is not in a position to make objective determinations about the report. \\\"The congressional leaders also took issues with the president's claims of being \\\"exonerated. \\\"On the campaign trail and on the Hill, Democrats made clear they are going to want every detail and document about the investigation and some have said they are willing to use their subpoena power in order to get it. \\\"It means make the request, if the request is denied subpoena, if the subpoenas are denied we will hold people before the Congress and yes, we will prosecute in court as necessary to get this information,\\\" House Intelligence Committee chairman Rep.  Adam Schiff, D-Calif. , said Sunday on \\\"This Week\\\". Democratic candidates running to unseat President Donald Trump in 2020 reacted quickly to the news that Mueller delivered his report to DOJ with one consistent message: Make it public. \\\"The Mueller report must be made public — all of it,\\\" Sen.  Kirsten Gillibrand, D-NY said in a presidential campaign speech outside the Trump International Hotel and Tower in New York City. She added: \\\"It is not often that I agree with Richard Nixon, but he was right to say that the American people have a right to know whether their president is a crook. \\\"The much-awaited report was handed to the Justice Department for Barr’s review, and Congress was notified of the transfer late Friday afternoon, according to a Justice Department spokeswoman. After reviewing Mueller's report, Barr will then send what he has described as his own \\\"report\\\" on the Mueller investigation to the top Democrats and Republicans on the House and Senate Judiciary committees.  Barr has promised to be as transparent as possible, but it's unclear how extensive or detailed Barr's own \\\"report\\\" to Congress will be. In a letter to the leaders of the House and Senate Judiciary committees, Barr wrote that he intends to \\\"consult with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and Special Counsel Mueller to determine what other information from the report can be released to Congress and the public consistent with the law. \\\"A senior Department of Justice official told ABC News on Friday that the report would not include any further indictments. Mueller and his team investigated how far the Kremlin went to interfere in the 2016 presidential election, including trying to determine whether any Americans may have helped those efforts. At the heart of Mueller’s probe were two Russian operations: the spread of disinformation on social media, and the release of thousands of sensitive emails stolen by hackers from the Democratic National Committee and other Democratic targets.  Mueller’s team has charged 25 Russian nationals and three foreign companies for their alleged role in those operations. In appointing a special counsel to investigate, however, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein also directed Mueller to look into “allegations” of possible “coordination” between Russian operatives and associates of President Donald Trump. Trump and his Republican allies have derided the investigation as a “witch hunt. ” But Rosenstein, FBI Director Chris Wray and Barr have each explicitly disputed that description. At least four Trump associates, including Trump’s former national security adviser Michael Flynn, have pleaded guilty to lying to federal agents during the Russia-related investigation. Another Trump associate, the president’s former attorney Michael Cohen, has pleaded guilty to lying to Congress about Trump’s business dealings in Moscow.  And former Trump adviser Roger Stone has been charged with lying to Congress about his alleged role in tracking information stolen from Democrats during the 2016 presidential campaign. Mueller’s investigation grew out of a probe the FBI launched in late July 2016. By then, the FBI was already scrutinizing Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort’s business dealings with pro-Russian officials in Ukraine – dealings that have since landed Manafort in jail.  And the FBI was keeping tabs on Trump adviser Carter Page, who was previously targeted for recruitment by Russian spies and had raised eyebrows with a trip to Moscow in mid-July 2016. But claims by Trump adviser George Papadopoulos – that the Russians were touting “dirt” on Clinton – really set off alarms inside the FBI. “If any Americans were part of helping the Russians [attack] us, that is a very big deal,” James Comey, who was FBI director at the time, later told lawmakers. Several weeks after formally launching the Russia probe, counterintelligence agents leading the investigation in Washington received a so-called “dossier,” which had been compiled at the behest of Democrats and detailed uncorroborated allegations of coordination between Trump’s campaign and the Kremlin. Some of the allegations involved Page, who was already on the FBI’s radar, so agents began secretly intercepting his communications.  Page has never been charged with any crimes. The wide-ranging investigation continued even after Trump took office.  After Jeff Sessions became attorney general, he recused himself from oversight of the FBI’s Russia-related probe, citing his previous advocacy for Trump on the campaign trail. Rosenstein subsequently assumed oversight of the investigation. And then Trump shocked the federal law enforcement community: He fired Comey. The move prompted Rosenstein to appoint Mueller to take over the whole matter, including a review of whether Comey's firing and other actions meant Trump improperly tried to obstruct the probe. Comey later alleged that in a private meeting with Trump before his removal, the president directed Comey to “let [Flynn] go. ”Mueller has not released any evidence suggesting Trump committed a crime related to Russian efforts. However, Mueller did uncover evidence of other possible crimes and referred those cases to other federal prosecutors. The U. S.  Attorney’s Office in Manhattan ended up tying Trump to federal campaign violations, alleging that – in the midst of the 2016 presidential campaign – Trump personally directed Cohen to silence two woman claiming affairs with Trump by making illegal payments to them; Trump has repeatedly denied the affairs. Cohen has pleaded guilty for his role in the matter, but no other charges have been filed.

C. Vice president’s chief of staff tests positive for COVID-19Five individuals in Vice President Mike Pence's orbit have tested positive for the coronavirus, including his chief of staff Marc Short and political aide Marty Obst. \\\"Today, Marc Short, Chief of Staff to the Vice President, tested positive for COVID-19, began quarantine and assisting in the contact tracing process,\\\" Devin O'Malley, press secretary for the vice president, said in a statement Saturday. Sunday morning, multiple sources familiar with the matter told ABC News that in addition to an outside political ally of Pence's, four of his staffers have tested positive.  One senior-level source stressed that the three staffers have been quarantining since the middle of this past week. Among those three staffers who tested positive and were in quarantine is Pence's \\\"body man,\\\" a position that often represents an individual who is the closest aide to the office holder. White House chief of staff Mark Meadows did not want to immediately reveal that Short and other members of staff close to the vice president had tested positive for the coronavirus, sources told ABC News. Defending this Sunday on CNN's \\\"State of the Union,\\\" Meadows said, \\\"Sharing personal information is not something that we should do, not something that we do actually do unless it's the vice president or the president or someone that is very close to them where there is people in harm's way.  Listen.  Any time that there is someone in harm's way, we have an obligation to let people know to contact trace.  We have done that. \\\"O'Malley said both Pence and wife Karen Pence tested negative for the virus on Saturday and a pool report indicated they tested negative again on Sunday morning. Pence has been crisscrossing the country on the campaign trail for weeks.  He made visits to Lakeland and Tallahassee, Florida, on Saturday.  On Friday, he spent time in his home state of Indiana, where he voted in person in Indianapolis, before holding rallies in Ohio and Pennsylvania.  He will continue his schedule, O'Malley said, despite the close contact with Short. \\\"While Vice President Pence is considered a close contact with Mr.  Short, in consultation with the White House Medical Unit, the Vice President will maintain his schedule in accordance with the CDC guidelines for essential personnel,\\\" he wrote in a statement. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advise essential workers who have been exposed to COVID-19 should take their temperature before work, wear a face mask at all times and social distance \\\"as work duties permit. \\\"Pence is scheduled to hold a rally in Kinston, North Carolina, on Sunday evening.  The vice president has also said he plans to be in the Senate on Monday for the vote on Judge Amy Coney Barrett's nomination to the Supreme Court. President Donald Trump, upon disembarking Air Force One at Joint Base Andrews, was asked about Short's positive test. \\\"I did hear about him just now and I think he's quarantining.  I did hear about him,\\\" the president said.  \\\"He's going to be fine but he's quarantining.  Thank you very much. \\\"Short has served as Pence's chief of staff since March 2019. Obst, a top political aide to the vice president, tested positive last week, multiple sources familiar with the matter told ABC News.  He is an outside adviser and not a government employee. He was spotted at a fundraiser at Trump Doral attended by both Pence and President Trump on Oct.  15.  While he was traveling with the VP last week, he wasn't in close proximity to him, sources say. Obst did not respond to a request for comment.  The vice president's office did not immediately respond. The trusted adviser, who ran Pence's campaign in 2016, has kept up a steady stream of tweets and retweets on Twitter in recent days and weeks, though he does not appear to have mentioned his own diagnosis. This is the second time someone close to Pence has tested positive for the virus.  Katie Miller, Pence's press secretary and wife of Trump adviser Stephen Miller, tested positive for COVID-19 in May. Both Mike Pence and the second lady tested negative for coronavirus in the days after Trump tested positive and was hospitalized at the beginning of October. Earlier this month, in an interview with CNN, Short said the vice president was tested \\\"every day. \\\"At least 34 people connected to the White House tested positive for the virus earlier this month, including the president and first lady Melania Trump, as well as press secretary Kayleigh McEnany, campaign manager Bill Stepien, senior adviser for policy Stephen Miller and outside advisers Kellyanne Conway and Chris Christie.

In an official statement, the LG noted that both the ruling coalition and Opposition have a strength of 14 members each in the legislative assembly, thus necessitating a floor test in the 30-member legislative assembly, where 16 is the magic number.

Bryant and his daughter were headed to a game at his Mamba Sports Academy in Thousand Oaks along with others connected to the basketball program. Here's a look at the other seven lives lost:College baseball coach John Altobelli -- whose daughter was a basketball teammate of Gianna Bryant -- was on the helicopter at the time of the accident. Altobelli, known as \\\"Alto,\\\" worked at Orange Coast College for 27 years and was known to be a mentor to players, according to the school. \\\"He truly personified what it means to be a baseball coach,\\\" the school's athletic director, Jason Kehler, said in a statement.  \\\"The passion that he put into the game, but more importantly his athletes, was second to none - he treated them like family. \\\"\\\"We have lost a member of our OCC family, and our hearts are broken,\\\" the college president, Angelica Suarez, added in a statement.  \\\"Coach Altobelli was a giant on our campus - a beloved teacher, coach, colleague and friend.  This is a tremendous loss for our campus community. \\\"\\\"John Altobelli was a great coach and man,\\\" tweeted Barry Faulkner, a sportswriter at the Daily Pilot in Southern California.  \\\"I worked closely with him for more than a dozen years covering his OCC program.  Huge heart.  Great sense of humor and passion for the game, his players and his family.  RIP Alto.  Truly a legend. \\\"John Altobelli's wife, Keri Altobelli, was also on board, along with one of their daughters. They left behind 16-year-old daughter, Alexis Altobelli, and son J. J.  Altobelli, John Altobelli's son from a previous marriage. Keri Altobelli was strong, direct and bold, but also \\\"loving and extremely loyal\\\" and \\\"embraced everything her family did,\\\" her friend, Lori Lever, said at the family memorial service. \\\"As the girls grew up, their personal passions became Keri's passions.  Managing the family schedule with baseball commitments for Alto, basketball for Lyssa, tennis and academics for Lexi, supporting J. J.  as he pursued a career in baseball like his dad,\\\" Lever said.  \\\"And the demands of Keri's own business left little time for anything else. \\\"\\\"Watching her do this effortlessly was nothing short of amazing,\\\" Lever said. Their 14-year-old daughter Alyssa Altobelli was a teammate of Gianna Bryant. She was a \\\"devoted basketball player\\\" with a solid work ethic, but she also \\\"always had my back,\\\" her friend Sammy Forbath said at the memorial service. Forbath recalled when they played on the same basketball team.  Instead of taking the shot, Alyssa would pass the ball to Forbath \\\"so I could make my first,\\\" she said. \\\"And when I'd miss, she'd look at me with a smile and say, 'Good try, you'll get the next one,'\\\" Forbath said.  \\\"She always was doing her best to make people happy and make them feel good. \\\"Payton Chester, an eighth grader at St.  Margaret's Episcopal School in San Juan Capistrano, California, was killed on the flight.

I picture her with the confidence to take that shot, the smile on her face when she hit it and the joy running back on defense as she celebrated with her teammates. \\\"Payton Chester's mother, Sarah Chester, was with her on the flight. Sarah Chester was on the board of trustees at her daughter's school. The 45-year-old had taught elementary school before retiring to raise her family, the San Gabriel Valley Tribune reported. She is survived by her husband and two teenage sons. Todd Schmidt, Payton Chester's former elementary school principal, said Sarah and Payton Chester \\\"were genuine, kind-hearted, and caring . . .  to the staff, to other families . . .  and yes, especially to me. \\\"\\\"While the world mourns the loss of a dynamic athlete and humanitarian, I mourn the loss of two people just as important,\\\" Schmidt wrote on Facebook.  \\\"Their impact was just as meaningful, their loss will be just as keenly felt, and our hearts are just as broken. \\\"Girls' basketball coach Christina Mauser leaves behind a husband and three young children.

Till now, J&K had a unique position among Indian states – it had its own Constitution and only a handful of laws that apply to other states were valid.  The legal provision that gave it this unique position was Article 370 of the Constitution, which the government effectively abolished by changing some of its aspect and cancelling out some others through an order. Also watch: ‘Bloodshed will end now’: HM Amit Shah on how Article 370 hurt J&K “The president on the recommendation of Parliament is pleased to declare as from 5th of August 2019, all clauses of the said Article 370 shall cease to be operative. . .  ,” said a resolution moved by home minister Amit Shah. The announcement came after days of uncertainty in the state, where the annual Amarnath Yatra that draws tens of thousands of pilgrims was abruptly called off last week while a large number of soldiers were moved.  The government had also imposed a security lockdown and cut all telecommunications in the early hours of Monday. Mixed reactionsThe decision drew angry reactions from many political parties, who said it amounted to going back on a promise that was made during the time when India got independence from the British.  Former chief minister Mehbooba Mufti said the decision reflected a desire of the Bharatiya Janata Party-led Union government to change the demography of Kashmir, where Muslims make up a majority. Her regional rival, National Conference leader Omar Abdullah said the move was “unilateral and shocking”, and a total “betrayal of trust” of the people of Jammu and Kashmir.  Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad in parliament said the government had “wiped out Jammu and Kashmir’s identity”. Some politicians, however, especially those from the BJP and their allies welcomed the decision. The historyTo understand the angry reactions, it is important to look at how the special status came into being.  During Independence and the partition of India and Pakistan, princely states – or regions that were ruled by a local leader in alliance with the British Raj – went through a process of integrating with either of the two countries. The then ruler of Jammu and Kashmir, Raja Hari Singh, decided to go with India by signing the Instrument of Accession treaty.  But, unlike most other states, the treaty set a crucial pre-condition: the local government of Jammu and Kashmir will make laws on all aspects of the state except three -- foreign relations, defence and communications. Thus, Article 370 was incorporated when India adopted its Constitution.  Subsequently, it became the basis for several privileges that were announced for people of J&K, such as restricting people from outside of the state to buy property or claim right to employment. What nowAll of these privileges will now be at par with UTs.  The Centre moved a draft law for parliament’s approval to turn J&K into one UT and Ladakh as another. For J&K, the government has proposed an assembly, which means the region will have a chief minister – but many of its crucial powers, such as those relating to police and land – will be controlled by the federal government, similar to what happens in the national capital of New Delhi. Pakistan, which claims the Kashmir region as its own, called the move illegal and said it will take “all possible steps” to counter it – the steps were not spelled out. \",\n  \"document_ocr\": \"THIS IS THE DEATI\\nOF DEMOCRACY!\\n#STANDWITHJ&K\\nTHIS IS THE DEATH\\nOF DEMOCRACY!\\nProtest at Town\\nHall, Bangalore\\n#STANDWITHJ&K\\non Monday\\n(05-08-2019)\\nat 5 30 pm\\nProtest at Town\\nHall, Bangalore\\nat 5 30 pm\\non M y\\n(os-o\\n\",\n  \"Category\": \"Insufficient_Text\"\n}, {\n  \"Id\": 34936,\n  \"claim_image\": \"http://pbs.twimg.com/media/EBSJaq8XYAA4bPl.jpg?format=jpg&name=large\",\n  \"claim\": \"Asaduddin Owaisi in Lok Sabha: I stand to oppose the bill.

Read full article hereSo what changes for Jammu and Kashmir now? The effective scrapping of Article 370 brings Jammu and Kashmir completely under Indian law, like any other state or UT.  Under the IoA, only matters of defence, communications and external affairs were under the Centre.  In addition, the 1954 Presidential order also created Article 35A, which empowered the state to define permanent residents and provide them special rights and privileges.  Now, Article 35 stands nullified. Why was this needed? As per clause 3, Article 370 could have only been scrapped after the state’s constituent assembly recommended it.  Currently, governor Satya Pal Malik is in-charge of the state, after the ruling coalition of Peoples Democratic Party and the Bharatiya Janata Party fell in 2018.  Hence, the clause added to Article 367 ensured that the Governor could be counted as the state, on whose recommendation the new presidential order was passed. First came the presidential orderOfficially called the Constitution(Application to Jammu & Kashmir Order) 2019, and signed by President Ram Nath Kovind, the order superseded the Constitution (Application to Jammu & Kashmir Order) 1954, and included two main points:It added a clause to Article 367, which clarified that references to representative of the President, as well as the state government could be construed as references to the Governor of Jammu and KashmirThe order will supersede (Application to Jammu and Kashmir Order) 1954, effectively nullifying Article 35A, which empowered the state to define permanent residents, giving them special rights and privileges. The ‘kill switch’Clause 3 of the article stated:“The President may, by public notification, declare that this article shall cease to be operative or shall be operative only with such exceptions and modifications and from such date as he may specify:Provided that the recommendation of the Constituent Assembly of the State referred to in clause (2) shall be necessary before the President issues such a notification. ”A Constitution order signed by the President could scrap the article, but it required the state’s constituent assembly to recommend this. What’s Article 370? Introduced in the Constitution in 1949, it expanded the state’s powers: any law passed by Parliament could apply as long as they formed part of the Instrument of Accession, and only after consultation with the state government.  Over time, this article was used to include several subjects, other than defence communications and foreign affairs that the Centre could legislate on. What made J&K different? Unlike other states, it had its own penal code, and specific laws for transfer of property, inheritance, personal laws, benami transactions, RTI etc.  While several items in the Union and Concurrent lists applied to J&K, parliament needed the state to ratify them. The four matters before Upper HouseThe four matters before Upper House:Constitution (Application to Jammu and Kashmir) Order 2019 – issued by President of India to supersede the 1954 order related to Article 370. Resolution for repeal of Article 370 of the Constitution of IndiaJammu and Kashmir (Reorganization) Bill, 2019Jammu and Kashmir Reservation (2nd Amendment) Bill, 2019Amit Shah to place four matters before the Rajya SabhaAmit Shah rose to place four matters before the Rajya Sabha, including a resolution that effectively nullified Article 370, which granted special powers to the state, and a bill that bifurcated it.  The state of Jammu and Kashmir, which became a part of Union of India on 26 Oct 1947, through an Instrument of Accession signed by the then ruler Hari Singh, had its own Constitution and framed its own laws in all areas except defense, external affairs and communications. \",\n  \"document_ocr\": \"DD\\nNEWS HD\\nLIVE\\n\",\n  \"Category\": \"Insufficient_Text\"\n}, {\n  \"Id\": 34937,\n  \"claim_image\": \"http://pbs.twimg.com/media/D0bOgXbXQAE5pir.jpg?format=jpg&name=large\",\n  \"claim\": \"Michael Cohen says it's possible that the entire Trump family was compromised by Russia in the months before the 2016 election https://t.co/4D2hrVPrdh https://t.co/9Ky8CHWtMv\",\n  \"claim_ocr\": \"House Oversight Committee\\nCapitol Hill\\n11:10 AM ET\\nMR.

What we learned from Michael Cohen's House Oversight Committee testimonyMichael Cohen, President Donald Trump's former lawyer and fixer, testifed publicly for the first time Wednesday about his experience in the Trump orbit before the House Oversight Committee, painting a harsh portrait of the president as an unscrupulous businessman who may have committed a crime while in office. Cohen also repeated what he said in a copy of his prepared remarks obtained by ABC News, claiming that Trump, as a candidate, knew his longtime confidant Roger Stone was talking with Julian Assange about WikiLeaks' possibly revealing emails hacked from the Democratic National Committee. In a statement to ABC News on Wednesday morning, Stone denied Cohen's allegation.  Julian Assange attorney Barry Pollack, in a statement, said, “Roger Stone did not have the telephone call Michael Cohen described. \\\"Here is how the hearing unfolded:5:20 p. m.  – Committee chairman in closing remarks: ‘We are better than this’In a fiery and impassioned speech to close out Wednesday’s blockbuster hearing after more than seven hours, Rep.  Elijah Cummings, D-Md. , called on members of his committee to “be better” as he sympathized with Cohen’s position. “We are better than this.  We are so much—we really are.  We are so much better than this,” Cummings said, adding, “when we are dancing with the angels, the question will be asked: in 2019 what did we do? ”Cummings’ sentiment drew an emotional response from Cohen, who appeared to be holding back tears when the chairman invoked the harm Cohen’s actions has caused his family. When he finished, Cummings pounded his gavel and adjourned the hearing more than seven hours after gaveling it in. 5:05 p. m.  – Cohen: If Trump loses 2020 election, 'I fear' there won’t be a peaceful transition of powerIn a dramatic statement at the conclusion of Wednesday’s hearing, Michael Cohen made a startling prediction: If President Trump fails to win a reelection bid in 2020, he may not give up his grip on power. “Given my experience working for President Trump, I fear that if he loses the election in 2020 that there will never be a peaceful transition of power,” Cohen said.  “This is why I agreed to appear before you today. ”Cohen then called on President Trump to cease attacks on the media, Gold Star families, and others. “You don't vilify people based on the god they pray to and you don't cuddle up to our adversaries at the expense of our allies,” Cohen said.  “You don't shut down to appease your base.  This behavior the office of the president and it simply is un-American. ”4:55 p. m.  – Democrat accuses GOP committee member of 'racist act'Rep.  Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich. , accused a Republican colleague of using a “black woman as a prop” during Wednesday’s testimony, sparking uproar from Republicans on the committee and calls for her comments to be stricken from the record. Tlaib’s statement came in response to Rep.  Mark Meadows, R-N. C. , inviting Lynne Patton, a current Department of Housing and Urban Development official and former longtime Trump Organization employee, to Wednesday’s hearing.  Meadows asked to include Patton’s statement defending Trump against accusations that he is “a racist” into the record.  Patton is a black woman. Meadows took issue with Tlaib’s remarks, offering an emotional rebuttal and defending his record of advocating civil rights for racial minorities. Tlaib clarified that she does not believe Meadows is a racist but accused him of “a racist act. ”4:45 p. m.  – Rep.  Ocasio-Cortez questions Cohen over Trump golf coursesIn a line of questioning by Rep.  Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N. Y. , Michael Cohen described how he said Donald Trump sought to garner tax deductions by reducing the value of his golf properties. Asked how the president did so, Cohen said, “you deflate the value of the asset and put in a request to the tax department for a deduction. ”Rep.  Ocasio-Cortez cited a lengthy New York Times article published in October describing “dubious tax schemes” Trump engaged in during the 1990s. 4:27 p. m.  – Hearing resumes after lengthy recessAfter a nearly two hour break -- an hour longer than stated -- members of the committee and Michael Cohen have returned to their seats for the final leg of questioning.  Overall, Cohen seems to have fended off most Republican attacks on him so far by taking a non-combative approach and repeatedly asserting that while he's lied previously, he's telling the truth now. 2:30 p. m.  – Stormy Daniels weighs in: ‘Michael, I’m proud of you’Shortly before the committee took what was expected to about an hour break for lunch, the adult film actress at the heart of president’s hush money payments controversy released a statement during Cohen’s testimony, saying she’s “proud” of Cohen for “finally beginning to tell the truth about what you did. ”Stormy Daniels, whose name has been repeatedly invoked over the course of Wednesday’s hearing for her role as the recipient of a hush money payment, appeared moved by Cohen’s testimony. “I can hear the pain and regret you feel for betraying your family and your country,” she said.  “Thank you for having the courage, at long last, to begin to tell the truth. ”Cohen executed the $130,000 payment to Daniels prior to the 2016 election.  President Trump has denied having an affair with Daniels. 2:10 p. m.  – Cohen describes plans to have Trump visit Russia during campaignMichael Cohen described negotiations he said he conducted with Trump campaign manager Cory Lewandowski “early on in the campaign” to have Trump visit Russia to “take a look” at the Trump Tower in Moscow project. Cohen and Lewandowski discussed the “possibility of which dates that Mr.  Trump would have availability if, in fact, that we were going to go over to Russia to take a look at the project. ”In November, Cohen pleaded guilty to lying to Congress about whether Trump and his company had pursued the Moscow real estate project while Trump was securing the GOP nomination in 2016. Cohen said the visit “never came to fruition because we were never successful in getting … ownership or control over a piece of property. ”1:45 p. m.  – Cohen contradicts Steele dossier, says he has never been to PragueMichael Cohen insisted under oath on Wednesday that he has never been to Prague or the Czech Republic, a central allegation in the dossier former MI-6 agent Christopher Steele compiled as opposition research. The dossier describes an incident in August 2016 in which Cohen allegedly traveled to Prague to meet with Russians.  Buzzfeed News posted the dossier in January 2017. Cohen has denied this claim in the past, including during an interview with ABC News. “I’ve never actually walked the land in Prague,” Cohen told ABC News.  “And last August I was not in Prague. ”1:25 p. m.  – Cohen says Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner’s attorney ‘reviewed’ his letter to Congress, tooAbbe Lowell, the attorney who represents the president's daughter and son-in-law, Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner, also reviewed Michael Cohen’s letter to Congress in 2017 that ultimately became the basis for charges Cohen lied to Congress, Cohen said Wednesday. They were not immediately available for comment. Cohen said earlier that Jay Sekulow, one of President Trump’s lawyers, made changes and additions to Cohen's statement, and mentioned that others may have, too. Late Wednesday afternoon, Sekulow issued a statement saying, “Today’s testimony by Michael Cohen that attorneys for the President edited or changed his statement to Congress to alter the duration of the Trump Tower Moscow negotiations is completely false. \\\"In his opening statement on Wednesday, Cohen said one of “Mr.  Trump’s personal lawyers reviewed and edited my statement to Congress about the timing of the Moscow Tower negotiations before I gave it. ”Cohen pleaded guilty in November to lying to Congress about whether Trump and his company had pursued the Moscow real estate project while Trump was securing the GOP nomination in 2016. 1:20 p. m.  – Cohen says Trump called him to coordinate messaging -- effectively lie -- about whether he knew about hush money paymentsMichael Cohen said during testimony on Wednesday that President Trump sought to coordinate public messaging about hush money payments to Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal in February 2018.  The women claim to have had affairs with Trump that he has denied. Trump instructed Cohen to say “he was not knowledgeable of the reimbursements and he wasn't knowledgeable of my actions,” Cohen said, referring to the hush money payments. Trump publicly denied knowledge of the payments before his attorney, Rudy Giuliani, confirmed later – in May 2018 – that Trump reimbursed Cohen for the $130,000 payment to Daniels. 1:00 p. m.  – Cohen says Trump lawyer Jay Sekulow made changes to his false statement to CongressMichael Cohen said one of President Trump’s lawyers, Jay Sekulow, made changes and additions to Cohen's statement to Congress in 2017 that ultimately became the basis for charges Cohen lied to Congress. In his opening statement on Wednesday, Cohen said one of “Mr.  Trump’s personal lawyers reviewed and edited my statement to Congress about the timing of the Moscow Tower negotiations before I gave it. ”He later identified that lawyer as Sekulow, who he said made “several changes … including how we were going to handle that message which was … the message, of course, being the length of time that the Trump Tower Moscow project stayed and remained alive. ”Sekulow has not addressed Cohen's claim. Cohen pleaded guilty in November to lying to Congress about whether Trump and his company had pursued the Moscow real estate project while Trump was securing the GOP nomination in 2016. 12:40 p. m.  – Cohen: Aware of another 'illegal act' Trump has committed, says SDNY investigatingMichael Cohen teased another “wrongdoing or illegal act” he claimed President Trump has committed, but said he could not give details because of an ongoing investigation headed by federal prosecutors in the Southern District of New York. Asked by Rep.  Raja Krishnamoorthi, D-Ill. , whether there is “any other wrongdoing or illegal act that you are aware of regarding Donald Trump that we haven't yet discussed today,” Cohen replied he was aware. “Yes,” he said, “and again, those are part of the investigation that's currently being looked at by the Southern District of New York. ”Cohen added that he is in “constant contact with the Southern District of New York regarding ongoing investigations. ”Outside the hearing room, SDNY had no comment. 12:30 p. m.  – Cohen to GOP: ‘Not one question so far has been about Mr.  Trump’In response to questions from Rep.  Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, Cohen called out Republicans on the panel for asking only about him and not President Trump. “I just find it interesting, sir, that between yourself and your colleagues, not one question so far since I'm here has been asked about President Trump,” Cohen said.  “That's actually why I thought I was coming today – not to confess the mistakes that I've made.  I've already done that. “The American people don't care about my taxes,” Cohen said.  “They want to know what it is that I know about Mr.  Trump, and not one question so far has been asked about Mr.  Trump. \\\"12:10 p. m.  – Cohen describes 'several factors' that led him to turn on TrumpAsked what caused him to turn on his longtime boss and effectively testify against him, Michael Cohen dramatically ticked off a list of Trump's actions and statements that led him to speak out. “Helsinki, Charlottesville, watching the daily destruction of our civility to one another, putting up with silly things like this,” Cohen said.  “It’s really unbecoming of Congress. ”Cohen said he used to protect Trump the way Republican members of the House Oversight Committee are protecting the president at Wednesday’s hearing. “I'm responsible for your silliness because I did the same thing that you're doing now for ten years,” Cohen said.  “I protected Mr.  Trump for ten years … I can only warn people the more people that follow Mr.  Trump, as I did blindly, are going to suffer the same consequences that I'm suffering. ”12:02 p. m.  – Cohen rejects accusation he’s trying to get a reduction in sentenceMichael Cohen denied a claim that his appearance is part of an effort to earn a reduction in his prison sentence. Asked by Rep.  Paul Gosar, R-Ariz. , whether his testimony could result in a reduction in his three-year sentence, Cohen said “it’s a possibility,” but rejected the notion that it is his purpose for testifying publicly before the House Oversight Committee. “I'm not sure how my appearance here today is providing substantial information that the Southern District can use for the creation of a case,” Cohen said, before joking, “Now if there is something that this group can do for me, I would gladly welcome it. ”Cohen is scheduled to report to prison on May 6. 12:00 p. m.  – Cohen describes Trump’s involvement in Trump Tower Moscow projectShortly before Michael Cohen asked for a break, he described what he said was the extent of Trump’s involvement in the Trump Tower Moscow negotiations during the campaign. “After each communication that I had [about the Trump Tower Moscow project], I would report back to [Trump] and our goal was to get this project,” Cohen said.  “We were interested in building what would have been the largest building in all of Europe. ”In his opening statement, Cohen said Trump remained directly involved in negotiations and often asked Cohen, “How’s it going in Russia? ”In November, Cohen pleaded guilty to lying to Congress about whether Trump and his company had pursued a Moscow real estate project while he was securing the GOP nomination in 2016. 11:45 a. m.  – Cohen pressed on his claim Trump is 'a racist'Rep.  Mark Meadows, R-N. C. , invited a guest to appear during his questioning of Cohen. Lynne Patton, a current Department of Housing and Urban Development official and former longtime Trump Organization employee, stood behind Meadows as he questioned Cohen about his allegation that Trump is “a racist. ”Meadows put a statement from Patton defending Trump into the record and asked Cohen to reconcile his claim with her defense of Trump as an African-American woman and the daughter of a man who grew up in Birmingham, Alabama. Cohen shot back by pointing out that he stands by his testimony as the son of a Holocaust survivor, prompting audible \\\"oohs\\\" from onlookers inside the hearing room. 11:30 a. m.  – Cohen hits back: 'Shame on you, Mr.  Jordan'Cohen, who once called himself Donald Trump’s “attack dog,” unleashed a heated rebuke of the ranking Republican on the committee, Rep.  Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, during a debate over whether Cohen accepted his guilt. Jordan read a quote the December indictment of Cohen written by federal prosecutors in the Southern District of New York.  It said Cohen’s “consciousness of wrongdoing is fleeting, his instinct to blame others is strong,” and accused Cohen of failing to appropriately show remorse for his actions. Cohen took issue with that characterization. “Shame on you, Mr.  Jordan,” Cohen said.  “That's not what I said.  What I said is, I took responsibility and I take responsibility … I am remorseful and I am going to prison. \\\"Cohen is scheduled to report to prison on May 6 to serve a three-year sentence. 11:12 a. m.  – Cohen says Trump and his children were ‘compromised’ by RussiaDuring a line of questioning about WikiLeaks’ release of internal Democrat National Committee and Hillary Clinton campaign emails, Cohen said he believes President Trump and his children may have been “conflicted or compromised” by Russia during the 2016 presidential campaign. He stopped short of characterizing the campaign’s alleged knowledge of the impending release of hacked Democrats’ emails as “collusion,” but said there was “something odd. ”\\\"As I stated in my testimony, I wouldn't use the word colluding,\\\" Cohen said.  Was there something odd about the back and forth praise with President Putin?  Yes.  But I'm not really sure that I can answer that question in terms of collusion. \\\"In his opening statement, Cohen claimed that Trump, as a candidate, knew his longtime political confidant Roger Stone was talking with Julian Assange about WikiLeaks' revealing of emails from prominent Democrats. 11:05 a. m.  – Cohen denies any desire to work in the White HouseRep.  Jim Jordan of Ohio, the ranking Republican on the committee and first to question Cohen, accused Cohen of acting in defiance of President Trump because he was upset at not getting a position in the White House after Trump’s election. Cohen categorically denied the allegation. “Mr.  Jordan, all I wanted was what I got, to be personal attorney to the president,” Cohen said. Cohen described an incident in which Trump \\\"reamed out\\\" former White House chief of staff Reince Priebus because Cohen hadn't gotten a job in the White House Counsel's office. 10:55 a. m.  – Questioning begins with an inquiry into hush money paymentsAfter Cohen’s 30-minute opening statement, the questioning portion of Wednesday’s hearing is underway. Rep.  Cummings, as committee chairman, began with a line of questioning about the hush money payments Cohen made to adult film actress Stormy Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, and his reimbursement by Trump. “The president said he knew nothing of these favors,” Cummings said.  “Based on your conversations with him, is there any doubt in your mind that President Trump knew exactly what he was paying for? ”“There is no doubt in my mind and I truly believe there is no doubt in the people of the United States of America,” Cohen said. Cohen presented a copy of a check Trump allegedly wrote, after taking office, to reimburse Cohen for the hush-money payment. Outside the hearing room, the Trump Organization responded that Donald Trump Jr.  had \\\"no concept/idea\\\" that he was signing a check to reimburse Cohen for the Stormy Daniels hush money payment.  Donald Trump Jr.  signed the $35,000 check as a trustee of the Donald J.  Trump Revocable Trust. President Trump has denied having an affair with Daniels. 10:42 a. m.  – Michael Cohen shares regrets, shame for a decade of work for Trump“And yet I continued working for him. ”That’s the refrain Michael Cohen is repeating after each damning anecdote he offers about President Trump.  Cohen’s opening statement included repeated mentions of how \\\"ashamed\\\" he feels now about his work for Trump. “I am ashamed because I know what Mr.  Trump is,” Cohen said. Cohen described with remorse the threatening letters he wrote on Trump’s behalf and the bidding he did for a man he called “a racist,” “a conman,” and “a cheat. ”“I am not a perfect man,” Cohen said.  “I have done things I am not proud of, and I will live with the consequences of my actions for the rest of my life. ”10:30 a. m.  – Cohen paints damning picture of Trump in opening statementMichael Cohen tore into President Trump’s character and business acumen in a scathing opening statement, calling him \\\"a racist,\\\" \\\"a con man\\\" and \\\"a cheat. \\\"ABC News reported details of Cohen’s intended testimony earlier on Wednesday. Cohen divulged that Trump, as a candidate, knew Roger Stone was talking with Julian Assange about WikiLeaks' revealing of emails from the Democratic National Committee. 10:25 a. m.  – Cohen sworn in, gives opening statementMichael Cohen began his opening statement after rising, raising his right hand, and being sworn in. \\\"Chairman Cummings, Ranking Member Jordan, and Members of the Committee, thank you for inviting me here today,” Cohen said.  “I am here under oath to correct the record, to answer the Committee’s questions truthfully, and to offer the American people what I know about President Trump. ”10:18 a. m.  – Ranking Republican slams Cohen, Democrats in opening statementThe ranking Republican on the Oversight Committee launched an early attack on Michael Cohen’s credibility and Democrats’ willingness to hear the former fixer’s testimony on Wednesday. “The first announced witness for the 116th Congress is a guy who is going to prison in two months for lying to Congress,” Rep.  Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, said in his opening comments. Jordan criticized Cummings for offering “a convicted felon a forum to tell stories and lie about the president of the United States so they can all start their impeachment process. ”“They just want to use you, Mr.  Cohen,” Jordan said.  “You're their patsy today. ”10:12 a. m.  – Chairman Rep.  Cummings warns Cohen not to lieIn his opening statement, the committee’s chairman, Rep.  Elijah Cummings, warned Cohen against lying to his panel. “I have made it abundantly clear to Mr.  Cohen that if he comes here today and he does not tell us the truth, I will be the first one to refer those untruthful statements to DOJ (the Department of Justice),” Cummings said. Cohen pleaded guilty to lying to Congress in December – charges brought by special counsel Robert Mueller. Cummings added that its hearing today and moving forward reflect a new era of Democratic oversight. “The days of this committee protecting the president at all costs are over,” he said. 10:07 a. m.  – Republicans move to postpone Cohen’s hearingA top Republican leveled an early effort to stop Cohen’s testimony, demanding the hearing be delayed. Rep.  Mark Meadows, R-N. C. , raised a procedural tactic to delay the hearing, citing the short notice of the committee’s receipt of Cohen’s testimony and evidence he plans to present. The committee voted down Rep.  Meadows’ point of order and the hearing continued. 10 a. m.  Cohen takes witness chair, hearing beginsMichael Cohen entered the committee at 10 a. m on the dot and took the witness chair for what promised to be dramatic testimony about his former boss Donald Trump before the House Oversight Committee.  The panel's chairman, Rep.  Elijah Cummings, D-Md. , gaveled in the hearing shortly thereafter. The man who once said he would take a bullet for Donald Trump is poised to excoriate his longtime former boss with more than a decade of anecdotes. In his opening statement, Cohen is expected to characterize Trump as a “racist” and a “conman. ”9:55 a. m.  Committee members gathering inside hearing roomMembers of the House Oversight Committee are gathering in the committee’s hearing room with just minutes until Michael Cohen is expected to take his seat. Democrats met this morning in committee chambers before congregating in the hearing room.  Republicans on the panel have set up large posters with Cohen’s past comments flattering the president. Cohen had no comment as he arrived on Capitol Hill.  As he left his hotel Wednesday morning, staff and hotel guests greeted and wished him well, some hugging him and people saying “God bless you. ”“I’m going to do the right thing,” Cohen said.  He also called it “the craziest day” of his life. Cohen, who spent a decade at Trump's side at the Trump Organization, will testify before House lawmakers at 10 a. m.  Wednesday as President Trump wraps up his first day of meetings with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Vietnam. Cohen is scheduled to begin a three-year prison sentence in May and has pleaded guilty to lying to Congress as well as financial crimes including bank and tax fraud.  Cohen also pleaded guilty to campaign finance violation for payments made to adult film star Stormy Daniels during the 2016 presidential campaign. The White House, along with Republicans on Capitol Hill, sought to discredit Cohen ahead of his appearance. \\\"Disgraced felon Michael Cohen is going to prison for lying to Congress and making other false statements,\\\" White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said Tuesday in a statement.  \\\"Sadly, he will go before Congress this week and we can expect more of the same.  It's laughable that anyone would take a convicted liar like Cohen at his word, and pathetic to see him given yet another opportunity to spread his lies. \\\"Rep.  Matt Gaetz, R-Fla. , a staunch Trump ally, also tweeted Tuesday that the hearing could reveal alleged details about Cohen's romantic life, prompting outrage from Democrats and ethics experts. The stakes were also high for Democrats in the House, who have vowed to investigate the president and conduct oversight of the administration amid accusations of overreach from Republicans. House Oversight Committee Chairman Elijah Cummings, D-Md. , suggested the hearing \\\"may very well be a turning point in our country's history. \\\"\\\"He's the only person that I know of who has accused this president of a crime,\\\" he told reporters on Monday. Cohen was prepared to provide lawmakers with documents to support his claims that Trump allegedly inflated and deflated his net worth for personal and professional gain, and to avoid paying property taxes, according to a source familiar with his intended testimony. The president's former fixer was also expected to explain why he lied to Congress in 2017 about discussions he had during the presidential campaign about the proposed Trump Tower Moscow. His specific allegation of criminal wrongdoing relates to Trump's reimbursement to Cohen for the payment to adult film actress and director Stormy Daniels, who alleged an affair with Trump, according to the source familiar with Cohen's planned testimony. Trump has denied the affair alleged by Daniels and another accusation from former Playboy model Karen McDougal and has previously said the payment amounted to nothing more than a \\\"simple private transaction,\\\" and that they do not qualify as campaign finance violations. Cohen appeared before the House Oversight and Reform Committee after postponing an initial hearing date, citing \\\"threats\\\" to his family by Trump and his lawyer Rudy Giuliani. On Tuesday he spent hours behind closed doors with the Senate Intelligence Committee and will meet with the House Intelligence Committee in private on Thursday. \\\"Two years ago when this investigation started, I said it may be the most important thing I'm involved in my public life in the Senate,\\\" Sen.  Mark Warner, D-Va. , the top Democrat on the panel, told reporters after the panel questioned Cohen.  \\\"Nothing I have heard today dissuades me from that view. \\\"\\\"We will call out the Democrats' charade for what it is -- a partisan circus meant to destroy President Trump,\\\" Reps.  Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, and Mark Meadows, R-N. C. , said in a USA Today editorial. At Cohen's sentencing hearing in December, special counsel Robert Mueller's team said Cohen had cooperated with their investigation. Ahead of the House hearing, during his day with the Senate Intelligence Committee, Cohen was officially disbarred as a lawyer in New York, according to a decision from the Appellate Division of the New York State Supreme Court expected after his November guilty plea.

US stock markets continue to plummet over coronavirus uncertaintyThe Dow Jones Industrial Average plummeted more than 350 points during a volatile trading day on Friday, as financial markets continue to dive on uncertainty over the spread of the novel coronavirus. The Dow suffered its worst week since the financial crash of 2008. The Dow was down by 1. 37% at closing.  The S&P 500 and Nasdaq experienced similar volatility Friday, with steep drops during mid-morning trading.  The S&P 500 closed down just 0. 82% and the Nasdaq closed up by 0. 01%. Overall, the Dow has lost more than 3,500 points this week, or more than 12%. As markets plunged, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell issued a rare statement Friday, saying they was \\\"closely monitoring\\\" the situation and \\\"will use our tools and act as appropriate\\\" if needed. \\\"The fundamentals of the U. S.  economy remain strong.  However, the coronavirus poses evolving risks to economic activity,\\\" Powell said.  \\\"The Federal Reserve is closely monitoring developments and their implications for the economic outlook.  We will use our tools and act as appropriate to support the economy. \\\"Prior to Powell's statement, the Dow was briefly down by more than 900 points during intraday trading Friday. Experts and analysts emphasize it is the uncertainty about the outbreak and its full financial impact that is driving the market volatility. \\\"Ultimately, it is the uncertainty that is most difficult to price in, so people are selling in the advance of concrete information,\\\" Chris Zaccarelli, the chief investment officer for Independent Advisor Alliance said Friday. \\\"Based on what we know now, it remains our belief that the impact to the economy will be severe, but not enough to create a recession,\\\" he added. Mark Hamrick, the senior economic analyst at Bankrate, noted that for long-term investors, \\\"This jolt is a bump in the road that will eventually only be a memory. \\\"\\\"As with the outbreak, we cannot be confident of the depth or duration of the market’s decline or the economic impacts in the short-term,\\\" he added in a note Friday.  \\\"But also similar to the spread of the virus, we know that it will have a conclusion.  It will take some time to arrive at that point. \\\"Hamrick added that, \\\"long-term investors with the ability and fortitude to remain in the market should do just that. \\\"\\\"This is for certain: One locks in a loss by selling,\\\" he said. The plunge comes as the U. S.  Food and Drug Administration announced it's been alerted to the first manufacturing shortage of a drug due to a viral coronavirus outbreak that began in China and has now reached American soil. Officials also warned Americans earlier this week to prepare for community spread of coronavirus in the U. S. , and companies have warned investors of supply chain issues related to the outbreak. Among the worst performers Friday were the Boeing Company, J. P.  Morgan Chase and the Travelers Companies, which fell by 4. 4%, 4. 3% and 3. 4%, respectively.

S.  government is over. President Trump tonight signed the continuing resolution that provides funding until Feb.  15.  The bill was signed in private tonight, without reporters present. Both the Senate and the House approved a measure to temporarily reopen the federal government.  The plan — which President Trump announced earlier today — will fund the government through Feb.  15. What happens now: The measure is heading to Trump's desk for his signature.  Once it is signed, it will put an end to the longest government shutdown in US history. You can follow the latest on the government shutdown here. From CNN's Liz StarkPresident Trump tonight is trying to push back on the way today’s agreement to reopen the government is being portrayed. He tweeted moments ago: From CNN's Phil MattinglyThe House of Representatives just passed a continuing resolution to fund the government until Feb.  15. The measure was passed by the Senate earlier today.  Now, it heads to President Trump's desk for his signature. From CNN's Liz Landers Over the past few days, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has been in “constant contact” with Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer as he had discussions with Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell on a path forward, according to a senior Democratic aide.  The two regularly consulted as those discussions proceeded. Throughout this shutdown, Pelosi made clear that the first step would be to reopen government and only then conduct negotiation.  This aide says it was “a position the President finally embraced today. ”This aide pointed to the 11 votes to reopen government since the Democrats took control on Jan.  3 as a key part of the strategy by Pelosi.  To do so many appropriations votes — starting with the individual Senate Republican bills — ultimately led to “unsustainable pressure on Senate Republicans. ”From CNN's Manu RajuSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell spoke with President Trump twice on Thursday — and Trump made the decision late Thursday that he wanted the shutdown to end, per a person familiar with their conversationsThe first call came after a contentious Senate GOP lunch where Republican senators vented frustration at Vice President Mike Pence about the lack of strategy to get out of the shutdown.  McConnell told Trump that it was unclear how much longer he could get GOP senators to hold the line — especially if there were another round of votes to end the shutdown. A few hours later, Trump called McConnell back with a new perspective: Trump made clear he wanted the shutdown to end, which led to the deal that was approved by Congress Friday. What's unclear, according to the source, is what exactly got Trump to change his mind in the intervening hours between their two phone calls. From CNN's Ashley Killough The House will vote at 6:30 p. m.  ET on the continuing resolution to end the government shutdown, a Democratic aide tells CNN. They'll also be voting on a Department of Homeland Security bill.  Both are expected to pass with unanimous consent.  After that, the resolution to fund the government will head to President Trump's desk for his signature. From CNN's Liz Landers  Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell flashed a quick smile at reporters as he walked off the floor to his office moments ago after the Senate passed a bill to reopen the government. When asked if anything good came out of this episode, Kentucky Sen.  Mitch McConnell said:Another reporter asked what finally ended the impasse — and specifically asked if it was the airport chaos we started to see materialize today. “You’d have to ask the President.  This was his proposal that we took up and passed. ”From CNN's Phil Mattingly and Liz LandersThe US Senate just passed the three-week continuing resolution to fund the government through Feb.  15.  The vote was by voice vote. The House still needs to pass the measure before President Trump can sign it.

Speaking at the launch of BJP’s first campaign for farmers in poll-bound West Bengal’s East Burdwan, which is considered the state’s rice bowl, Nadda cited the measures the government has taken over the last six years for the farm sector.  “Since the BJP came to power at the Centre [in 2014], Prime Minister Narendra Modi has made a six-fold increase in the central budget for farmers.  He implemented the minimum support price [at least 50% more than the weighted average cost of production] recommended by the Swaminathan Committee,” Nadda saidNadda insisted the three farm laws will make farmers free.  “These will enable farmers to set the price of their products and choose the buyer,” Nadda said. Nadda’s statement came a day after the eighth round of talks between the Centre and farmer unions failed to end the deadlock on Friday.  The Centre maintained it would not scrap the three laws and asked farmer unions to wait for the Supreme Court to weigh in on the issue.  The farm leaders stuck to the stand that the laws must be repealed and raised placards saying they will “prevail or die”. Sharp exchanges and tense arguments between the two sides were also reported even as they agreed to meet again on January 15. Thousands of protesting farmers have encircled Delhi for 45 days, demanding the government scrap the laws. The Supreme Court is set to take up a bunch of petitions challenging the validity of the laws on Monday.  The petitions have argued that the federal government does not have the powers to bring legislation on the agriculture sector because it falls in the domain of states.  The farm leaders have said even if the laws were declared constitutionally valid, they would continue to demand their repeal. Nadda, who also said that Bengal ranks 24th in the country when it comes to procurement price paid to farmers, announced the BJP will hold 40,000 meetings across Bengal before the assembly elections. Nadda also launched the door-to-door rice collection programme.  He visited five homes and collected the rice in a saffron bag slung on his left shoulder. Nadda, who offered prayers at the temple associated with the 15th-century saint Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, later had lunch at a farmer’s house. Nadda’s visit to Bengal comes as the Trinamool Congress (TMC) government is planning to hold a special session of the assembly to pass a resolution against the three farm laws. Nadda said the enthusiasm he has noticed shows that people of West Bengal have made up their mind to welcome the BJP.  He added chief minister Mamata Banerjee has now written to the Centre that she wants to implement the Prime Minister Kisan Samman Nidhi programme.  “We have been asking her for a long time to do it. ”Nadda accused the TMC leadership of corruption and misappropriating ration the Centre sent in view of the Covid-19 pandemic.  “Smuggling of coal and sand is all that you hear about these days.  The Calcutta high court ordered an audit into the expenses made towards relief [after cyclone Amphan].  But the government challenged it in the Supreme Court.  Why?  Why is Mamata Banerjee so worried? ” TMC Lok Sabha leader Saugata Roy reacted to Nadda’s comments, saying the BJP chief is from Himachal Pradesh and questioned what does he know about Bengal.  “Spreading misinformation will not help the BJP.  The TMC will return to power with an absolute majority. ” Nadda was scheduled to offer prayers at the Sarbamangala temple in Burdwan, lead a roadshow and visit the BJP district office to address the media and the party’s core committee members. \",\n  \"document_ocr\": \"\",\n  \"Category\": \"Insufficient_Text\"\n}, {\n  \"Id\": 34941,\n  \"claim_image\": \"http://pbs.twimg.com/amplify_video_thumb/1110020017716756480/img/xlrlHwpNnXNOiweb.jpg?format=jpg&name=large\",\n  \"claim\": \"“We need to see it and we need to see it in full, and we need to see it as rapidly as possible,” says iconic journalist Carl Bernstein on the Mueller report.\\n\\n“Then we’ll learn the full story and maybe the American people could get some resolution and calm about this.\\\" https://t.co/KD0zX79hWY\",\n  \"claim_ocr\": \"Cambridge, MA\\n9:35 PM ET\\nHARVA\\nKenned\\n71740\\ndiiHS C\\nSNIP\\nBREAKING NEWS\\n2020 DEM CANDIDATES REACT TO AG CONCLUSIONS OF MUELLER REPORT\\nCNN\\n9:35 PM ET\\nAC360°\\n\",\n  \"document_image\": \"http://pbs.twimg.com/media/D2giOSdUgAERM4o.jpg?format=jpg&name=large\",\n  \"document\": \"Questions probed by Mueller have been kicked over to the political processes. Trump touts 'no collusion with Russia' after Mueller reportThe TAKE with Rick KleinNo collusion, no obstruction and no prosecution -- that's true to a point, and a significant point at that. But despite what President Donald Trump says, there is no exoneration.  There is certainly no conclusion to the issues that have consumed much of the Trump presidency, either. The questions probed by special counsel Robert Mueller and examined by the Department of Justice have now been kicked over to the political processes that were always going to have to deal with them anyway. Mueller was imbued with unrealistic expectations that he would render final judgments on an immensely complicated series of subjects.  He left it to the attorney general to determine whether the president obstructed justice, and Democrats on Capitol Hill will ask questions about that decision. Beyond that, and beyond the calls for the full Mueller report to be released, the Democratic presidential candidates are largely shrugging off the end of the Mueller era.  Most of them have long known he was never going to do the hard work for them. \\\"We need to recognize that's not going to change a lot of hearts and minds,\\\" Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, said over the weekend regarding the release of the Mueller report. The focus on Mueller will be in large measure about what he didn't find and what he opted not to do. But what he did bring to light -- in taking his time, in submitting his findings and in drawing out presidential actions along the way -- will be quite enough for the political system to digest for a long while. The RUNDOWN with John VerhovekWhile the key findings of Mueller's report have been made public, Democrats vying for the party's presidential nomination are still preaching transparency.  And as they prepare to campaign in the post-Mueller era, they are beginning to search for an effective messaging strategy that can no longer rely on the uncertainty surrounding the famed prosecutor's findings. \\\"It is not often that I agree with Richard Nixon, but he was right to say that the American people have a right to know whether or not their president is a crook. \\\" Sen.  Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N. Y. , said Sunday during her official campaign launch speech standing in front of the Trump International Hotel and Tower in New York City. \\\"Nobody, including the president of the United States, is above the law.  The people have a right to know what's in that report,\\\" Sen.  Bernie Sanders said over the weekend during a swing through California. But in a sign that they have known for some time that their hopes of beating Trump in 2020 could never depend on the contents of Mueller's report, most Democratic presidential hopefuls -- Gillibrand and Sanders included -- are instead focused on pitching policies and honing a message of an America that could move on from the partisan bickering and rancor that has defined the last two years. \\\"I am not running for president because of who I'm fighting against, I'm running for president because of who I'm fighting for,\\\" Gillibrand said Sunday. Sen.  Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass. , has been running a policy-centric campaign, while former Texas Congressman Beto O'Rourke is pitching himself as a unifying figure that could transcend the nastiness of today's political discourse. Whatever Mueller's full report does reveal, the tone of these Democratic contenders indicates that their strategy for victory in 2020 is not just to offer an anti-Trump argument, but to articulate a clear vision of the type of change they want to see in this country. The TIP with Samantha SergiDemocratic presidential candidates flocked to South Carolina in an attempt to court the black vote, but there were actually very few black voters at four events ABC News covered this weekend. Noticeably, O'Rourke and Buttigeig lacked diversity among the crowds they drew on Friday and Saturday in Columbia and Rock Hill, South Carolina.  Both cities are made up of roughly 47 percent of people of color. At a meet-and-greet event with O'Rourke on the University of South Carolina's campus in Columbia, five young, black women left 13 minutes into his speech when he was talking about the mass incarceration of black men. Compared to Sen.  Cory Booker, D-N. J. , and O'Rourke, Buttigeig drew the largest overall crowd during a Q&A session in the gymnasium of Clinton College, a historically black college in Rock Hill, South Carolina.  While the crowd was large, there were only a handful of people of color in attendance. THE PLAYLISTABC News' \\\"Start Here\\\" podcast.

This comes after the state’s premier administrative block witnessed a surge in coronavirus cases among its staff.  “On account of the increase in Covid-19 cases in the Secretariat, Departments/Offices it is directed that not more than 50% strength of the secretariat employees shall attend the office on a particular day and the remaining employees shall work from home on an alternate day basis,” an order issued by the joint secretary of general administration said.  The orders which come into effect from August 31 will remain in force at least until September 11, the order stated.  The comes over ten days after a staff of the secretariat protested against the government’s inaction in introducing social distancing measures for employees.  Back then, the number of cases was only around a dozen.  It has now crossed 50.  Also read: Unlock 4. 0 - What to expect from September 1On August 18, around 150 employees, alarmed by the rising Covid-19 cases in the administrative complex, had gathered in the foyer while a few called on the chief secretary to urge him to introduce either a 50 percent workforce or staggered a mode of working for the employees.  “If this continues like this then we will all become positive and the administration will totally collapse.  So before it collapses, the government should do something and send out some guidelines.  We cannot work from home because we don’t have amenities.  At least we can work at 50 percent strength, but there should be some clarity on how we are supposed to work,” Sukarna Pai, an employee of the revenue department, said.  Besides the secretariat, several other government departments have been plagued by Covid-19 with cases being detected in the electricity department, rural development agency, the Goa State AIDS Control Society and some district court complexes.  The Goa government also resisted making it optional for teachers to work and conduct online classes from home.  Instead, the government insisted that they report to school on all working days which led to some cases of infection among teachers. \",\n  \"document_ocr\": \"\",\n  \"Category\": \"Insufficient_Text\"\n}, {\n  \"Id\": 34943,\n  \"claim_image\": \"http://pbs.twimg.com/media/E0gykxMVkAA2Fob.png?format=jpg&name=large\",\n  \"claim\": \"As MK Stalin sets out to take charge of Tamil Nadu, many challenges loom ahead\\n\\n(report by @bydivyac) \\n\\nhttps://t.co/IYBFExneBq https://t.co/T6kEXKG6fL\",\n  \"claim_ocr\": \"\",\n  \"document_image\": \"http://pbs.twimg.com/media/ExUxSAHVcAQjA3b.jpg?format=jpg&name=large\",\n  \"document\": \"After a decade in opposition and the shadows of his father and five-time chief minister late M Karunanidhi, the big moment for Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) chief MK Stalin finally arrived on Sunday as the DMK-led alliance won 159 seats out of 294 in the Tamil Nadu assembly polls. While Stalin had led the party to a sweeping victory in the 2019 parliamentary elections, by winning 38 out of 39 seats, this year’s assembly election was a crucial test for his leadership as well as the future of his party. Click here for full coverage on electionsThe 68-year-old chief minister-elect for Tamil Nadu is ready to take on the new role at a time when the state is fighting the Covid-19 surge, debt and many more challenges. Here is taking a look at five challenges that the Stalin-led government would have to immediately deal with after assuming charge. Covid-19The current state government’s efforts to keep the pandemic under check was one of the major poll campaign highlights of outgoing chief minister Edappadi Palaniswami’s AIADMK and their ally BJP.  While they were knee jerk reactions, Palaniswami came on his own when the state, like others, was hit by the virus.  Tamil Nadu set a benchmark in conducting the highest number (2,29,56,942) of RT-PCR tests in the country and setting a low mortality rate of 1. 19% as compared to Maharashtra's 1. 49% and Delhi's 1. 42%.  An efficient health system that worked last year was introduced once again. Stalin will have to face a second wave that is more virulent.  Hospitals are filling fast and health workers are overworked.  The active caseload in the state is now twice as compared to last year and the same is thrice the number in Chennai, the state’s hotspot.  The new political appointees will have to ensure a smooth functioning with the bureaucratic arm of the state which has tackled the virus all this while.  There is also a massive vaccination program awaiting the state as it doesn’t have adequate supply to inoculate the population above 18 years of age. FinancesA huge financial burden is awaiting the new government.  In February, the AIADMK-led government presented a revenue deficit interim budget.  The state’s debt stood at ₹4. 87 lakh crore as of March 31, 2020, which was likely to go up to ₹5. 7 lakh crore amid the pandemic situation.  The state’s tax collection also remained low since 2016 amidst the overall economic decline, demonetisation and introduction of the Goods and Services Tax (GST).  The state has also complained of not receiving its due share as devolution from the central taxes and cesses and surcharges were not forming a part of the divisible pool of taxes. In its election manifesto, the DMK had said, “The incompetent AIADMK-led government has increased Tamil Nadu’s outstanding debt to about 9 lakh crores, thus resulting in every newborn carrying a debt of 1. 25 lakh rupees.  To make the necessary intervention and to advise the government on suitable action plans, a high-level expert committee shall be constituted. ”The DMK has promised a universal basic income of ₹1,000 for women heads of households, waive off education loans of students aged below 30 years, provide free tablets with data to school and college government students and a payout of ₹1,500 to 32 lakh widowed women, all single women above 50 years of age, differently-abled and Sri Lankan refugees. The new government will have to spend higher on healthcare, reboot the economy while also keeping several of its election promises, which may cause a huge burden on the exchequer. EmploymentProviding more job opportunities to youngsters and women has been an election promise of the DMK as the unorganised sector has been most hit by the pandemic and lockdown-like restrictions.  The party had also assured to pass legislation to reserve 75% of jobs for the locals.  It set a goal of providing 10 lakh jobs each year and 50 lakh jobs to youngsters by the end of 2025-26.  It promised to bring in more industries and increase the number of working days under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) from 100 to 150 days. EducationThe Covid-19 pandemic has pushed schools and colleges to conduct online classes and reduce the curriculum, affecting students’ learning.  According to the Annual Status of Education Report released in October 2020, at least a quarter of students in Tamil Nadu was not involved in any learning activity during the entire week of the survey period. The state government had earned the criticism of educationists as well as the Madras high court over its order to cancel arrear exams in arts and science colleges and declare students as “all-pass”.  The new government will require an expert committee to help address the setback for students in the past year and discuss the way forward. Administration/ PoliticsThe state’s relationship with the Centre will play a critical role for the new government keeping in mind that Stalin has remained on a head-on collision with the AIADMK-BJP combine.  While the DMK chief has promised to retrieve the state’s rights and autonomy, it remains to be seen how he intends to negotiate via requests and tackle troubles with the BJP-led Centre. \",\n  \"document_ocr\": \"MANI\\n\",\n  \"Category\": \"Insufficient_Text\"\n}, {\n  \"Id\": 34944,\n  \"claim_image\": \"http://pbs.twimg.com/media/D2dwqseU0AAcOj_.jpg?format=jpg&name=large\",\n  \"claim\": \"Democrats want Attorney General Barr to testify before Congress on Mueller report: \\\"The American people are entitled to a full accounting of the president's misconduct referenced by the special counsel.\\\" https://t.co/U5T5Tx8cgl https://t.co/9r12VG9oWA\",\n  \"claim_ocr\": \"abc\\nNEWS\\nHOUSE OF\\nU.S.\\nThe president has not been exonerated\\nFOX\\n5 AP\\nby the special counsel,\\nREPRS\\n\",\n  \"document_image\": \"http://pbs.twimg.com/media/D2geJXVWsAMQHf1.jpg?format=jpg&name=large\",\n  \"document\": \"\\n  Former White House aide Cliff Sims suggested Monday President Donald Trump may use the findings of special counsel Robert Mueller’s report as a “political bludgeon” against Democratic presidential candidates.  \\n\\n  On Sunday, Attorney General William Barr said in a letter to Congress that Mueller’s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election did not find that the Trump campaign conspired with Russia.

Chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal instructed the authorities of the affected districts to reach out to the flood-hit people on a war footing and adhere to the Covid-19 safety protocols during the relief-and-rescue operations. The deluge claimed one more life in the worst-hit Dhemaji district, where over 91,000 people are affected, according to the daily flood bulletin of the Assam State Disaster Management Authority (ASDMA). The number of flood-hit people in Dhemaji, Jorhat, Majuli, Sivasagar and Dibrugarh districts was 38,000 on Wednesday, while the swirling floodwaters entered Lakhimpur, Biswanath, Golaghat and Tinsukia districts, raising the figure to 1. 89 lakh on Thursday. Tinsukia and Dibrugarh districts were also badly affected, accounting for 24,239 and 18,500 flood-hit people respectively, the ASDMA said. The flood has submerged 19,430 hectares of farm land with standing crops. The authorities are running 49 relief camps and distribution centres in five districts, where 11,468 people have taken shelter. The Brahmaputra river is flowing above the danger mark at Neamatighat in Jorhat district, Dhubri town in Dhubri district and Tezpur in Sonitpur district, the bulletin said. Besides damaging roads and other infrastructure, the floodwaters have caused massive erosion at various places. Meanwhile, the chief minister took stock of the flood situation and asked the deputy commissioners to provide essential relief materials to the affected people, according to official sources. He asked the Tinsukia DC to ensure that the fire tenders moving to and from Baghjan, where a gas well has been blazing for the last 30 days, do not face any bottleneck. A bridge on the way to Baghjan was damaged in the flood and a Bailey bridge should be built there for unhindered movement of the vehicles engaged in emergency services, the chief minister said. Sonowal also asked the state-owned power utility, Assam Power Distribution Company Limited, to take steps to avert accidents due to electrocution. In view of the coronavirus outbreak, he directed the DCs to ensure that the district machinery assiduously adheres to the Covid-19 safety protocols.  \",\n  \"document_ocr\": \"\",\n  \"Category\": \"Insufficient_Text\"\n}, {\n  \"Id\": 34946,\n  \"claim_image\": \"http://pbs.twimg.com/media/EsV8SlDXYAEp_cv.jpg?format=jpg&name=large\",\n  \"claim\": \"From J-K to Kerala, bird flu spreads to 13 Indian states, union territories\\n\\nhttps://t.co/QjAxdgnZFD https://t.co/dstagiopLR\",\n  \"claim_ocr\": \"\",\n  \"document_image\": \"http://pbs.twimg.com/media/ErcRn58UUAAymSn.jpg?format=jpg&name=large\",\n  \"document\": \"Signalling a second wave, 13 Indian states have reported bird flu outbreaks till Friday affecting poultry birds, crows, migratory birds and wild birds.

The flu has been confirmed in poultry samples from Uttarakhand's Almora and Gujarat's Somnath, the ministry said. In crows, the flu has been confirmed in Jammu and Kashmir's Kulgam, Anantnag, Budgam and Pulwama) and Uttarkhand's Kaliji Pheasantbird in Tehri range, the ministry said. Avian Influenza has been confirmed in crows in the States of UT of Jammu and Kashmir(Kulgam, Anantnag, Budgam and Pulwama); in Kaliji Pheasantbird inTehri range of Uttarakhand. Soon after the outbreak killed more than 25,000 birds earlier this month, the government had rushed to control the outbreak and prevent further spread by asking states to strengthen the biosecurity of poultry farms, disinfect the affected areas, and properly dispose of dead birds and carcasses. The animal husbandry ministry had also asked states for timely collection and submission of samples for confirmation and further surveillance and intensification of surveillance plan. To prevent the disease transmission from affected birds to poultry and humans, the ministry has asked states to follow the general prevention guidelines. “Coordination with the forest department for reporting any unusual mortality of birds was also suggested to the States.  The other states were also requested to keep a vigil on any unusual mortality amongst birds and to report immediately to take necessary measures,” the ministry said in a statement. Bird flu, also known as Avian Flu, is a variety of influenza caused by a virus in birds.  It can spread to humans and can trigger person to person transmission, experts say.  There are many varieties of viruses and H7N9 is considered most dangerous among them, they say.  According to the World Health Organization there are many subtypes of avian influenza virus and only some of them will be dangerous to humans.  Migratory birds are reported to be the main carriers of the virus. The Union ministry of fisheries, animal husbandry and dairying has previously pointed to migratory birds as a cause for the spread of flu which has triggered an alarm in north, central and southern India.  “In India, the disease spreads mainly by migratory birds coming into India during winter months i. e.  from September-October to February-March.  The secondary spread by human handling (through fomites) cannot be ruled out,” the ministry had said. \",\n  \"document_ocr\": \"GOVERNMENT OF KERALA\\n\",\n  \"Category\": \"Insufficient_Text\"\n}, {\n  \"Id\": 34947,\n  \"claim_image\": \"http://pbs.twimg.com/media/DyCAgJ2X0AAiD_f.jpg?format=jpg&name=large\",\n  \"claim\": \"The price of a \\\"Forever\\\" stamp just went up a nickel -- to 55 cents.

In Minnesota, wind chills could be as low as minus 35 degrees Monday night and as low as minus 65 degrees Tuesday into Thursday morning, the National Weather Service warned.

The snow then moved on to a chilly Chicago. Over 1,000 flights were canceled at Chicago's airports Monday as the snow hit. The weather dangers had hit the Midwest even before the snowstorm.  This weekend, Chicago police officers rescued a man and his dog from a frozen Lake Michigan. The same storm will head south and is set to bring slippery roads to Atlanta and Birmingham Tuesday morning. Overnight Monday into Tuesday rain will change to an icy mix and snow even as far south as Mississippi and Louisiana when temperatures dip below freezing. City government offices in Atlanta will be closed Tuesday, the mayor said. By Tuesday night the storm will move across the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic with rain changing to snow from North Carolina to Maine. Six to 12 inches of snow could hit parts of the interior Northeast before the storm leaves Wednesday morning. New York City, Washington and Boston will likely just see rain.

From CNN's Samantha BeechPresident Trump promised North Korea a \\\"tremendous future for your country\\\" in his first talks with leader Kim Jong Un in Hanoi.  \\\"I think your country has tremendous economic potential,\\\" Trump said. \\\"I think you will have a tremendous future for your country, you’re a great leader,\\\" Trump told Kim.  \\\"We will help it to happen. \\\"Watch the moment here:From CNN's James GriffithsPresident Trump and North Korean leader Kim have met for the second time.  The two leaders clasped hands and posed in front of flags smiling as members of the international press took photos.  Trump said he looked forward to a \\\"very successful\\\" summit.  Kim said \\\"we have been able to overcome all the obstacles and here we are today. \\\"In response, Trump said \\\"it's an honor to be with Chairman Kim, it's an honor to be together in Vietnam. \\\"\\\"It's great to be with you, we had a very successful first summit,\\\" he added.  \\\"Some people wanted to see it go quicker, but I was very happy with how we are doing. \\\" Trump said the two leaders' relationship is \\\"really a good one. \\\" Neither man responded to shouted questions from the press, most of which were targeted at Trump, one reporter audibly asking about recent revelations by the President's former lawyer, Michael Cohen.  Watch the greeting: From CNN's James GriffithsPresident Trump has arrived at the Metropole Hotel, where he will shortly be meeting North Korean leader Kim.  Onlookers lined the motorcade route from the hotel where Trump is staying while in Hanoi, waving and holding up their phones.  The route took the US President past the North Korean embassy. Kim's motorcade is also en route to the hotel.  From CNN's Joshua Berlinger in HanoiAccording to a schedule released by the White House, President Trump and North Korean leader Kim will be arriving at the Metropole Hotel shortly, where they will be meet in person for the second time ahead of a private dinner tonight.  Nearby the hotel, which has been largely cordoned off to the public amid heavy security, the famous Lotus Water Puppet Theater has erected portraits of the two leaders, one showing Trump waving in front of the US and Vietnamese flags.  From CNN's Joshua Berlinger in HanoiNorth Korean leader Kim Jong Un is due to meet President Trump on Wednesday evening to begin their second summit. The outcome is highly unpredictable but experts said there are many ways Kim could declare the summit a victory. \\\"Kim Jong Un has several paths to a win in Hanoi -- and unfortunately Trump seems determined to make it happen,\\\" said Adam Mount, Senior Fellow and Director, Defense Posture Project, Federation of American Scientists. \\\"Kim gains a modest win by just showing up and repeating his performance at Singapore -- being seen to engage the United States as a nuclear power, gaining new opportunities for diplomacy and trade and raising the chance of sanctions relief from Beijing and Seoul. \\\"From CNN's James GriffithsA lot of what President Trump and North Korean leader Kim discuss at their second summit in Hanoi will be kept private, but can we learn anything from their body language?  Translation and interpretation expert Julie Giguere thinks so, she says their behavior at the previous meeting in Singapore showed evidence of their different cultural backgrounds and gave insight into their feelings.  \\\"When moving from initial meeting to the summit setting, Trump invited Kim to walk ahead of him.  This could be interpreted as a desire to calm the situation and the President also used his hand to guide the younger man, which can be seen as an indication of a desire to assert dominance,\\\" Giguere said in an email. \\\"While the two leaders spoke last time, Kim spent most of the time looking down and listening while Trump spoke in a largely conciliatory manner.  Trump’s more aggressive body language and Kim patting Trump on the shoulder, both of which were interpreted as a desire to assert control, belied the apparent passivity on both sides. ” She added it was important for observers to take into account differences in American and North Korean etiquette.  \\\"The bow plays an important role in Korean greetings and etiquette in general.  This is one of the ways in which Trump could show a small amount of recognizable politeness and respect to the North Korean leader without being too friendly, especially given they have met before,\\\" Giguere said.  \\\"Giving a straight 'no' is simply not done in North Korean business etiquette.  You might suggest a 'maybe,' but you would never just say 'no. ' It's an easy way to be very rude and this is something on which the President should certainly have been advised. \\\"From CNN's James GriffithsPresident Trump has tweeted again from Hanoi, where he is due to be meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in a couple hours, saying the pair will \\\"try very hard to work something out\\\" with regard to denuclearization.  He added that he believes \\\"China, Russia, Japan & South Korea will be very helpful! \\\" Please enable JavaScript for a better experience. \",\n  \"document_ocr\": \"\",\n  \"Category\": \"Insufficient_Text\"\n}, {\n  \"Id\": 34949,\n  \"claim_image\": \"http://pbs.twimg.com/media/DxxwtMYXgAANacs.jpg?format=jpg&name=large\",\n  \"claim\": \"Longtime Trump associate Roger Stone vows to fight Mueller charges https://t.co/OEF5J8phrr https://t.co/OXzc5RsbQj\",\n  \"claim_ocr\": \"JOE RAEDLE GETTY IMAGES\\n\",\n  \"document_image\": \"http://pbs.twimg.com/media/DxxX1kTXgAYYwl5.png?format=jpg&name=large\",\n  \"document\": \"Stone is a longtime friend and confidante of the president. FBI arrests longtime Trump adviser Roger StonePresident Donald Trump's longtime friend and veteran political operative Roger Stone was arrested Friday morning after special counsel Robert Mueller filed a seven-count indictment against him as part of an ongoing probe into Russia interference during the 2016 presidential election. The special counsel leveled against Stone, 66, five counts of lying to Congress, one count of obstruction of an official proceeding, and one count of witness tampering. Stone was arrested and appeared in court in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, late Friday morning.  The indictment was filed on Thursday. Within hours of the FBI’s pre-dawn arrest at his home in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, Stone made an initial court appearance Friday morning, where a federal judge set his bond at $250,000 and limited his travel to Florida, New York, Virginia and Washington, DC, where he will be arraigned next week. The charges brought by Mueller’s office largely revolve around false statements Stone is accused of making to the House and Senate Intelligence Committees regarding his communications with associates about Wikileaks. In court documents unsealed Friday morning, Mueller’s prosecutors wrote that after WikiLeaks began releasing internal Democratic National Committee emails in the summer of 2016, an unidentified \\\"senior Trump campaign official was directed to contact Stone about any additional releases and what other damaging information [Wikileaks] had regarding the Clinton Campaign. \\\"\\\"Stone thereafter told the Trump Campaign about potential future releases of damaging material by [Wikileaks],\\\" prosecutors say. In a hastily organized press conference following his court appearance, a defiant Stone pledged to fight the charges. “I am falsely accused of making false statements,” he said, shouting over protesters outside the courthouse.  “There is no circumstance whatsoever under which I will bear false witness against the president. . .  I look forward to being fully and completely vindicated. ”Stone, 66, struggled to shout over protesters chanting “lock him up! ” – a reference to chants of “lock her up” directed at Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton at Trump rallies during the 2016 campaign. Although never mentioned by name, WikiLeaks' alleged role in the 2016 presidential campaign was previously referenced in Mueller’s indictment of 12 Russian intelligence officers, whom the special counsel’s office accused of hacking Democrats' emails. During the campaign, WikiLeaks published emails allegedly hacked and stolen from Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign chairman John Podesta and documents from the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and Democratic National Committee.  Some of the hacked emails were first published on the \\\"DCLeaks\\\" website, which Mueller alleges was a front for Russian military intelligence, known as the GRU. In addition to the pre-dawn raid on his Florida home, federal agents obtained a search warrant for Stone’s New York home – described as a “spacious two bedroom” apartment in Harlem.  Agents were spotted Friday taking hard drives and other evidence from the apartment. An attorney for Stone, Grant Smith, chalked up Stone’s alleged lies to Congress as “something he honestly forgot about” and “vowed to fight the charges. ”President Donald Trump weighed in with a tweet, calling Mueller’s investigation the “Greatest Witch Hunt in the History of our Country! ” One of Trump’s lawyers, Jay Sekulow, released a statement arguing that “the indictment today does not allege Russian collusion by Roger Stone or anyone else,” adding, “rather, the indictment focuses on alleged false statements made to Congress. ”Stone, who has taken credit for persuading Trump to get into politics, served as an adviser to Trump’s presidential campaign but left amid controversy in 2015. Rep.  Eric Swalwell, a Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, to which Stone is accused of making false statement, told ABC News Friday he believes the indictment is important because “it shows the Trump Organization was aware of his efforts.  It shows there was awareness of Stone’s efforts to get the hacked emails. ”“It also puts into context why Donald Trump was talking so much about WikiLeaks,” Swalwell said.  “Why was Trump talking so often about new information that was coming?  Why was he talking so much about WikiLeaks?  Why did he make that invitation to the Russians?  Now you know they had a connection in Roger Stone. ”House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Friday night issued a statement saying it is \\\"staggering that the President has chosen to surround himself with people who violated the integrity of our democracy and lied to the FBI and Congress about it. \\\"\\\"The indictment of Roger Stone makes clear that there was a deliberate, coordinated attempt by top Trump campaign officials to influence the 2016 election and subvert the will of the American people,\\\" Pelosi said in the statement. The youngest person to testify in the Senate Watergate hearings at the age of 20, Stone – who is known for - among other things - a tattoo of Nixon's face on his back– was profiled in a 2016 Netflix documentary, \\\"Get Me Roger Stone,\\\" which focused on his eccentric political career and painted him as the original architect of Trump’s political career. The special counsel’s indictment comes amid scrutiny about the self-described “dirty trickster” and his alleged contact with WikiLeaks publisher Julian Assange in the summer of 2016.  Stone has told ABC News multiple times that he had never met or spoken with Assange and had no intermediary providing a back channel to communicate with the controversial WikiLeaks founder. Mueller's interest in Stone and WikiLeaks goes to the heart of the U. S.  intelligence community’s conclusion, released in a report in January 2017, that the online organization weaponized and published damaging information provided to it by a hacker from the Russian government on Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and her campaign. In July, the mercurial Stone told ABC News that he is the unnamed Trump campaign regular who allegedly corresponded with Russian hackers, as described in special counsel Mueller’s July 13 indictment against a dozen Russians intelligence officers, who were posing as a hacker, Guccifer 2. 0.  The indictment alleges that the 12 Russians engaged in a sustained effort to hack Democrats and aides to Clinton during the 2016 presidential campaign.  Stone has dismissed his short Twitter direct message communications with Guccifer 2. 0 as innocuous and denied knowledge that Russian agents were behind the account. More than a dozen witnesses associated with Stone have been contacted by the special counsel's office, many of whom have appeared before the grand jury impaneled by Mueller’s team.  The witnesses have told ABC News they were asked about Stone’s dealings during the 2016 election and what, if any, contact he may have had with Assange through an intermediary. Among them is political humorist and radio show host Randy Credico, whom Stone claims to have asked to act as an intermediary for him to contact Assange to confirm that the Wikileaks founder had a cache of information on Clinton during the 2016 campaign. The list also includes Jerome Corsi, the former Washington bureau chief of the far right site, Infowars, who is known for his role in pushing political smear campaigns. Over the course of his nearly two-year-long probe, Mueller and his team of prosecutors have now indicted 34 individuals and three Russian businesses on charges ranging from computer hacking to conspiracy and financial crimes. Those indictments have led to seven guilty pleas and three people sentenced to prison.  Four former Trump campaign officials -- including his onetime national security adviser Michael Flynn and campaign chairman Paul Manafort, also a former associate of Stone – are among those who have pleaded guilty. In October, ABC News reported that special counsel prosecutors had been asking Manafort — their newest cooperating witness — about Stone, who was Manafort’s friend and had also been his partner at the lobbying firm Black, Manafort, Stone and Kelly in the 1980s, according to multiple sources familiar with the matter. Stone told ABC News in November, “There’s no circumstance under which I bear false witness against President Trump. ”ABC News' Aaron Katersky, Janice McDonald, Scott Withers and Tom Llamas contributed to this report.  24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events\",\n  \"document_ocr\": \"abc\\n\\\"When I read this\\nNEWS\\nindictment this\\nmorning, it once\\nagain proved out\\njust how smart\\nand careful Robert\\nMueller is being...\\nThis has got to be\\na very disturbing\\nday for some\\nsenior members\\nof the Trump\\ncampaign.\\\"\\nCHRIS CHRISTIE\\n\",\n  \"Category\": \"Insufficient_Text\"\n}, {\n  \"Id\": 34950,\n  \"claim_image\": \"http://pbs.twimg.com/media/EzpCd5fVgAA8O0L.jpg?format=jpg&name=large\",\n  \"claim\": \"Provide vaccine to the states at the same rate as the Central govt.

Soren said, “The government is working day and night to help people during this period of drastic transition.  I believe we can beat coronavirus with cooperation from all. ”Earlier, the state government urged the central government to reduce the previous age limit of 45 for vaccine beneficiaries in light of the rapidly spreading infection among younger people.

As per a bulletin of the state health department, more than 25. 15 lakh people were administered the first dose of the vaccine till Thursday, while over 3. 93 lakh people received their second dose. However, a decline in footfall of first dose seekers was witnessed on Thursday, that some health experts blamed on the confusion arising due to the ongoing week-long lockdown in the state that began April 22.  However, no major change was witnessed in the case of second dose beneficiaries. Even though state nodal officer (vaccination) Dr Ajit Prasad expressed his inability to comment on the matter, as he was also suffering from Covid-19 infection, officials at a vaccination office said the drop in footfall of first dose seekers was witnessed, while it partially increased in case of second dose. “There are many reasons behind the slight fall in case of first dose.  There may be confusion over lockdown, while some may be scared of visiting vaccination centres due to the sudden case surge.  However, we are working to address the issue and we hope it will increase soon,” a senior official said, requesting anonymity.

From CNN's Jason HoffmanCedric Richmond, senior adviser to President Biden, said there is no new timetable from the White House on police reform legislation, but said he is optimistic over the state of the negotiations. Richmond said the administration is “doing everything we can” to get legislation passed including offering any advice or technical assistance asked of it. Richmond said there is not a new timeline from the White House on passing police reform, after the original deadline of today came and went without a bill, and that the President wants something that is right, not rushed.  “It’s more important to have meaningful legislation than to meet a deadline or a timeline and I think that that came out today in the conversation with the family, that the President wanted something that is right, not necessarily rushed,” he said.  Richmond would not discuss the negotiations over qualified immunity during the interview, saying those negotiations have been going on behind the scenes and that’s where they should stay.  From CNN's Jason Hoffman and Phil MattinglyVice President Kamala Harris spoke about her meeting with the family of George Floyd at the White House on Tuesday, saying “they have shown such dignity in the face of such an atrocious tragedy. ”“In their grief, they are so generous in the way that they have been supporting other families and supporting a system that should rightly yield in the face of injustice to what we know needs to be reformed,” she added. The vice president said she is in awe of their continuing courage, their selflessness and the way they have approached this. Harris also echoed her written statement after the meeting with Floyd’s family, saying “George Floyd should be alive today. ”She said the administration is watching and waiting to see what comes from the negotiations on police reform on Capitol Hill. “The work that they have been doing has been I think intensive work throughout the weekends,” Harris said.  “So they’re working around the clock from everything I can see and we’re waiting to hear but there seems to be a sense of optimism coming from the Hill and that gives me a sense of optimism and we’ll wait and see. \\\"From CNN's Jessica DeanBenjamin Crump, the attorney of George Floyd's family, said GOP Sen.  Tim Scott told him any policing overhaul bill will be named the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act.  Crump and the Floyd family spoke with reporters following their meeting with Democratic Sen.  Cory Booker.  When asked earlier by reporters if they’re optimistic about a police reform deal getting done, Crump gave them a thumbs up. From CNN’s Omar Jimenez and Keith AllenDarnella Frazier, the teenager who was on her way to a Minneapolis store to buy snacks with her young cousin last May 25 when she recorded the clearest video of former police officer Derek Chauvin pressing his knee into George Floyd’s neck for over nine minutes, released a statement on Tuesday to mark the one-year anniversary of Floyd’s death. “A year ago, today I witnessed a murder.  The victim’s name was George Floyd.  Although this wasn’t the first time, I’ve seen a Black man get killed at the hands of the police, this is the first time I witnessed it happen in front of me.  Right in front of my eyes, a few feet away,” Frazier said in a statement to CNN. Frazier’s video of Floyd’s final moments was widely credited for helping secure a guilty verdict against Chauvin, and Minnesota Gov.  Tim Walz publicly thanked her after the trial. \\\"Taking that video, I think many folks know, is maybe the only reason that Derek Chauvin will go to prison,\\\" Walz said last month. “A lot of people call me a hero even though I don’t see myself as one.  I was just in the right place at the right time,” Frazier said Tuesday. “Behind this smile, behind these awards, behind the publicity, I’m a girl trying to heal from something I am reminded of every day.  Everyone talks about the girl who recorded George Floyd‘s death, but to actually be her is a different story,” Frazier added. Frazier, now 18, said her life was forever changed by that moment, and she spoke about the challenges she and her family have faced in the year since she witnessed Floyd’s death, adding that she’s suffered from sleeplessness, anxiety and panic attacks in the aftermath. “I used to shake so bad at night my mom had to rock me to sleep.  Hopping from hotel to hotel because we didn’t have a home and looking over our back every day in the process,” the statement read. From CNN's Elise HammondAs the sports world came together to pay their respects to George Floyd after his death in Minnesota a year ago, many organizations are also speaking out on the anniversary of his killing on Tuesday. Floyd's death sparked nationwide protests, with many prominent athletes and teams participating in advocacy and demonstrations. The Women's National Basketball Players Association released a statement on the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act – a bill that would do things like set up a national registry of police misconduct, ban chokeholds and no-knock warrants and make it easier to prosecute officers for wrongdoing, among other things. The WNBPA said in a statement it remains hopeful and that the measure is an \\\"important first step for comprehensive policing reform. \\\"\\\"Excessive force used against communities of color is past crisis-level.  Excessive force used against communities of color demands action by Congress,\\\" the statement said. The National Basketball Players Association tweeted, \\\"How many more need to be killed before Congress takes action? \\\" It urged people to call their senators and tell them to support the bill. The NBA said a year ago Floyd's death inspired a social justice movement and called on people to rally against systemic racism, it said in a tweet. \\\"Today and every day, members of the NBA family stand united in working for change and a future that provides true equality,\\\" the NBA said. Several high-profile NBA athletes were vocal about the killing of Floyd. Professional teams in Minnesota – including the Vikings, the Timberwolves, the Lynx, the Wild and Minnesota United – all tweeted messages in Floyd's memory.  Several of them were photos of memorials or murals around the city. The Players Alliance, the Major League Baseball players group, tweeted a statement pledging to create a more \\\"inclusive, equitable future – both in our game and in our world. \\\"The NFL said it has been a year filled with \\\"reflection and reckoning, one that has renewed our commitment to build and strengthen our communities. \\\"It also tweeted a video which featured players talking about how Floyd's murder affected them.

Scott told CNN on Tuesday after the meeting that he felt the Floyd family was very receptive to all the parts of the bill they discussed. “I was pleasantly surprised and encouraged by their thoughts,” Scott said, adding, “I wish I was negotiating with them. \\\"One year ago today, George Floyd was killed by a police officer in Minneapolis.

Harris said that the video of Floyd’s death one year ago “revealed to the country what Black Americans have known to be true for generations. ”“The verdict finding Derek Chauvin guilty of murder provided some measure of justice.  But one verdict does not address the persistent issue of police misconduct and use of excessive force.

Trump wraps US-North Korea summit with press conferenceHanoi, Vietnam -- President Donald Trump and North Korea's Kim Jong Un concluded their second summit in Vietnam in an apparent stalemate, with Trump announcing U. S.  negotiators walked away over North Korea's insistence that it relax some sanctions before full dismantlement of the country's nuclear program. Trump and Kim met at the historic Metropole Hotel in downtown Hanoi, which is 12 hours ahead of Eastern Standard Time, after a brief one-on-one meeting Wednesday and an hour and a half-long dinner with their top aides, including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney. Trump touted the two days of meetings as \\\"productive\\\" and downplayed any deterioration in his personal rapport with the young leader, who he said committed to not carry out any further nuclear or missile tests as negotiations continued. \\\"You always have to be prepared to walk,\\\" Trump said at a press conference.  \\\"I could have 100 percent signed something today.  We actually had papers ready to be signed, but it was not appropriate.  I would rather do it right.  I would rather do it right than fast. \\\"As he prepares to return to major political headwinds back in Washington, Trump dismissed the bombshell testimony of his former personal lawyer Michael Cohen as 'fake' and attacked Democrats for holding the hearing while he was seeking a nuclear agreement. Here's how the day unfolded:3:51 a. m.  (EST) - Trump departs Hanoi, VietnamThe president has departed Hanoi, Vietnam.  He is headed back to the United States, following his second summit with North Korea's leader. \\\"I am about to get on a plane and fly back to a wonderful place called Washington, D. C. , \\\" Trump said, with a hint of sarcasm, at the end of his roughly 40-minute-long press conference. The president was originally scheduled to depart two hours later, but the cancellation of a signing ceremony with Kim moved up the travel schedule. Based on the shift in his schedule, Trump was expected to arrive in Washington late Thursday evening, following a refueling stop at a yet-to-be disclosed location. 2:55 a. m.  (EST) - Trump says he has confronted Kim about Otto Warmbier's death, but believes Kim's denials of responsibilityTrump told reporters in Vietnam that in his meetings with Kim he confronted the leader about Otto Warmbier.  The 21-year-old American student was arrested and imprisoned in North Korea for more than a year.  He died after returning to the U. S.  in a state of unresponsive wakefulness, according to his family. However, the president signaled that he believed Kim didn't share any personal responsibility in Warmbier's death. \\\"I really believe something very bad happened to him and I don't think that the top leadership knew about it,\\\" Trump said.  \\\"I did speak about it and I don't believe that [Kim] would have allowed that to happen.  Just wasn't to his advantage to allow that to happen. \\\"Trump added that Kim \\\"felt badly\\\" about Warmbier's death and described North Korea's prison system -- condemned around the world, by multiple human rights groups, as \\\"rough places. \\\"\\\"You got a lot of people, it's a big country, a lot of people,\\\" Trump said.  \\\"And in those prisons and those camps you have a lot of people and some really bad things happened to Otto, some really, really bad things.  But he tells me he didn't know about it and I will take him at his word. \\\"The White House has said in the past that the talks between Kim and Trump were focused almost solely on denuclearization, rather than the issue of North Korea's human rights record. The moment is likely to stir significant controversy, similar to Trump's statement in Helsinki last year accepting Russian President Vladimir Putin's denials of interference in the 2016 U. S.  election, as well as his acceptance of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's rejection of responsibility for journalist Jamal Khashoggi's murder. 2:49 a. m.  (EST) - Trump downplays breakdown in talks, says Kim told him nuclear testing 'will not start' up againDuring his press conference, the president dismissed the idea that the breakdown of his talks with Kim meant their relationship has soured.  He said Kim has committed to him that nuclear and missile tests will not restart, despite no agreement being reached. \\\"He said the testing will not start,\\\" Trump said.  \\\"He said he is not going to do testing of rockets or missiles or anything having to do with nuclear. \\\"Trump again heaped praise on the young leader, continuing the trend of emphasizing his personal relationship with Kim even amid the stalled talks. \\\"We just like each other,\\\" Trump said.  \\\"We have a good relationship.  It's a totally different system to put it mildly but we like each other. \\\"Trump said a sticking point in the negotiations came over the U. S.  demands that North Korea dismantle its Yongbyon nuclear enrichment facility, which Kim wouldn't agree to unless sanctions were relaxed on the country. \\\"We had to have more than that,\\\" Trump said.  \\\"We brought many points up that I think they were surprised we knew, but we had to do more than just the one level, because if we did the one level and gave up all that leverage that has taken a long time to build. \\\"2:24 a. m.  (EST) – Trump slams ‘fake’ Cohen hearing: ‘He lied about a lot’Trump offered his first reaction to the congressional testimony by his former personal lawyer Michael Cohen during a press conference in Hanoi, labeling Cohen as a \\\"liar\\\" and hitting Democrats for holding the hearing during his summit with Kim. \\\"I think having a fake hearing like that and having it in the middle of this very important summit is really a terrible thing,\\\" Trump said. When asked by ABC News’ Chief White House correspondent Jonathan Karl about the allegations leveled by Cohen against him, Trump said Cohen was \\\"incorrect\\\" to call him a \\\"liar,\\\" \\\"a con-man\\\" and a \\\"racist. \\\"\\\"He lied a lot,\\\" Trump said.  \\\"But it was very interesting because he didn't lie about one thing, he said, 'no collusion with the Russian hoax. ' I said, 'I wonder why he didn't lie about that too like everything else? '\\\"\\\"I was a little impressed by that, frankly,\\\" Trump said. 2:18 a. m.  (EST) – Trump explains North Korea summit ending without an agreement: ‘Sometimes you have to walk’At a press conference prior to his departure from Hanoi, Trump explained why his second summit with Kim resulted in no signed agreement between the two countries as previously planned. \\\"We thought, and I thought, and Secretary Pompeo felt that it wasn't a good thing to be signing anything,\\\" Trump said.  \\\"Sometimes you have to walk.  This was just one of those times. \\\"Pompeo went on to explain that Kim was \\\"unprepared\\\" to go as far in the agreement as the U. S.  had wanted, but that negotiating teams would continue to convene in the \\\"days and weeks ahead\\\" to resolve their differences. Trump acknowledged the break down was due to North Korea’s demands that sanctions be lifted in exchange for steps towards denuclearization, which would amount to a departure from longstanding U. S.  policy that no sanctions be lifted before North Korea completely dismantles its nuclear program. \\\"It was about the sanctions,\\\" Trump said.  \\\"Basically they wanted the sanctions lifted in their entirety and we couldn't do that. \\\"1:40 a. m.  (EST) - White House says 'no agreement' reached between Trump and Kim as talks are cut shortTrump has returned to his hotel after negotiations with Kim were cut short.  The White House announced that \\\"no agreement\\\" was reached between the two leaders despite \\\"very good and constructive meetings. \\\"\\\"The two leaders discussed various ways to advance denuclearization and economic driven concepts,\\\" Sanders said in a statement.  \\\"No agreement was reached at this time, but their respective teams look forward to meeting in the future. \\\"Reporters were informed just an hour earlier that a previously scheduled 'Joint Agreement Signing Ceremony' was cancelled altogether, along with a photo-opportunity of a working lunch between the two delegations. The shortened talks appeared to catch the White House off guard, with the announcement coming after the press office had already sent reporters a menu for the lunch that was inevitably cancelled. Trump in recent days has seemed to lower expectations for in terms of announcing any concrete steps towards North Korea's denuclearization, though he hailed the talks as \\\"productive\\\" during a photo-op earlier in the day with Kim. Prior to his departure from Hanoi, Trump was expected to provide updates on the summit and will likely take questions on his former personal lawyer Michael Cohen's bombshell congressional testimony when he holds a press conference around 2 a. m.  E. T. 12:48 a. m.  (EST) - White House announces 'change of plans'After a significant delay in what was supposed to be a photo-op of the \\\"working lunch\\\" between the U. S.  and North Korean delegations, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders informed reporters of a significant change of plans. Sanders told reporters that the day of negotiations would wrap up in roughly 30 minutes, and that Trump would return to his hotel for a press conference two hours earlier than originally planned. It was not immediately clear whether the schedule change meant that the 'Joint Agreement Signing Ceremony' between Trump and Kim originally on the White House schedule had been scrapped altogether. 11:46 p. m.  (EST) – Kim indicates willingness to denuclearize, open US liaison office in PyongyangAnswering yet another round of questions from reporters, Kim seemed to indicate a willingness to rid his country of nuclear weapons, but also that he is open to the idea of a U. S.  liaison office in the North Korean capital of Pyongyang. When asked by a reporter if he was \\\"ready to denuclearize,\\\" Kim answered, \\\"if I'm not willing to do that I [wouldn’t] be here right now,\\\" according to an interpretation from his translator. The answer drew laughs in the room and seemed to surprise Trump, who has repeatedly softened expectations for what might come from the summit. \\\"That's a good answer, wow! \\\" Trump replied.  \\\"That might be the best answer you've ever heard. \\\"A reporter then followed up, asking if he was willing to take \\\"concrete steps\\\" to denuclearize, a sticking point for negotiators looking to gain access for inspections to North Korean facilities and a full accounting of its current arsenal. \\\"That is what we are discussing right now,\\\" Kim answered. \\\"And don't raise your voice, please,\\\" Trump added.  \\\"This isn't like dealing with Trump. \\\"The exchange seemed to amuse Kim. \\\"They all seem to be anxious,\\\" Kim said of the reporters. \\\"I think they're anxious and they're calm,\\\" Trump said. After some remarks from Trump, where he described their negotiations as \\\"productive,\\\" reporters again tried to engage the two leaders, with one asking whether Kim would be willing to allow the opening of a U. S.  consular office in Pyongyang. A member of the North Korean delegation then seemed to try and wave the press out of the room, but Trump used the moment to press the issue. \\\"It's actually an interesting question though,\\\" Trump said.  \\\"I would like to actually hear that answer, because it's actually not a bad idea. \\\"Kim then answered through his translator, saying, \\\"I think that is something which is welcomeable. \\\"Reporters were then ushered out of the room. 11:20 p. m.  (EST) - Kim takes more questions from reportersKim fielded some questions from Western reporters in Hanoi during his latest appearance with Trump. One journalist asked Kim if he’s \\\"ready to denuclearize. \\\"\\\"If I’m not willing do that I won’t be here right now,\\\" he said through an interpreter. Trump responded, \\\"That's a good answer. \\\"10:10 p. m.  (EST) - A history-making question?  Analysis from ABC News Chief White House Correspondent Jonathan KarlAs journalists were being escorted out of the first photo-op of the day between Kim and Trump, a reporter asked the North Korean leader a question. \\\"Chairman Kim, are you confident? \\\"There was a pause.  Would Kim take a question?  He turned back to look at his translator and listened. \\\"It's too early to tell,\\\" Kim said, looking at the reporters after hearing the translation.  \\\"I wouldn't jump to conclusions.  From what I feel right now, I do have a feeling that good results would come out. \\\"Maybe not a ground-breaking answer, but a historic one. This appears to be first time Kim has answered a question from the Western press.  His father never did that.  Nor did his grandfather. The moment followed controversy Tuesday, after the White House prevented a group of print reporters from attending a photo-op of Trump's dinner with Kim after the reporters attempted to ask questions of the leaders in a previous spray. 9:38 p. m.  (EST) - Trump, Kim complete their one-on-one bilateral meetingFollowing their one-on-one bilateral meeting, Trump and Kim walked together through a courtyard alongside a pool followed by their translators to join Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and DPRK Vice Chairman Kim Yong Chol. 9 p. m.  (EST) – Trump: \\\"When you have a good relationship a lot of good things happen\\\"Trump and Kim are holding a photo op at the Metropole hotel downtown. Trump briefly spoke about his \\\"good relationship\\\" with Kim ahead of their day of negotiations. \\\"A lot of good ideas being thrown about,\\\" Trump said.  \\\"When you have a good relationship a lot of good things happen. \\\"Trump also appeared to downplay the idea that any major action would result from the sit-down meeting, emphasizing that he's \\\"in no rush\\\" and highlighting what he described as significant economic opportunities for North Korea in the event Kim agrees to denuclearize. \\\"I can't speak necessarily for today, but a little bit longer term and over a period of time I know we’re going to have a fantastic success with respect to Chairman Kim and North Korea,\\\" Trump said.  \\\"I think it's going to be an economic powerhouse.  It is something I look forward to helping with, because with a little bit of help in the right location and the right place, I think it will be something very special. \\\"In what could be his first-ever exchange with a Western journalist, Kim briefly answered a Washington Post reporter's question who asked if he was \\\"confident\\\" about the negotiations. \\\"It's too early to tell,\\\" he said through his interpreter.  \\\"I wouldn't jump to conclusions.  From what I feel right now, I do have a feeling that good results would come out. \\\"Trump and Kim are scheduled to meet privately for 45 minutes before sitting down with their top diplomatic aides for a more extensive meeting. 8:55 p. m.  (EST) - What to expectWhether Kim has any interest in in an agreement remains the fundamental question at the heart of Trump's summit diplomacy, one that the U. S.  intelligence community and North Korea analysts have grave doubts about. The two have another personal meeting, joined only by their translators for 45 minutes, before a nearly two-hour long session with their negotiating teams.  In addition to Pompeo and Mulvaney, Trump is expected to be joined by U. S.  Special Representative for North Korea Stephen Biegun, who has been in Hanoi for the last week trying to reach an agreement for Trump and Kim to sign in a signing ceremony for a joint agreement, but it's unknown what that document will say. The last summit in Singapore was criticized for its joint declaration, which committed both countries to pursuing the \\\"complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula,\\\" a term that was never defined and means very different things to either side. For the U. S. , it's the unilateral disarmament of North Korea, including all its nuclear capabilities, ballistic missiles and chemical and biological weapons.  But North Korea has shown no interest in doing so, instead seeking sanctions relief and normalized relations with the U. S.  while handing over some small concessions, like inspections or verification of testing sites North Korea claims it has dismantled. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events\",\n  \"document_ocr\": \"abcNEWS LIVE\\nBREAKING NEWS TRUMP AND KIM FACE-TO-FACE\\nPresident Trump and Kim Jong Un meeting now behind closed doors\\n\",\n  \"Category\": \"Insufficient_Text\"\n}, {\n  \"Id\": 34953,\n  \"claim_image\": \"http://pbs.twimg.com/media/D0djQ41XcAA-hdH.jpg?format=jpg&name=large\",\n  \"claim\": \"President Trump seeks a news reset with Kim Jong Un after Michael Cohen's testimony https://t.co/VRXpT2jt8o https://t.co/4xGjw32yb2\",\n  \"claim_ocr\": \"\",\n  \"document_image\": \"http://pbs.twimg.com/amplify_video_thumb/1100954917903220736/img/rHl-yeTKnPBtAj1A.jpg?format=jpg&name=large\",\n  \"document\": \"Negotiations were wrapped up early and no agreement was reached. Trump wraps US-North Korea summit with press conferenceHanoi, Vietnam -- President Donald Trump and North Korea's Kim Jong Un concluded their second summit in Vietnam in an apparent stalemate, with Trump announcing U. S.  negotiators walked away over North Korea's insistence that it relax some sanctions before full dismantlement of the country's nuclear program. Trump and Kim met at the historic Metropole Hotel in downtown Hanoi, which is 12 hours ahead of Eastern Standard Time, after a brief one-on-one meeting Wednesday and an hour and a half-long dinner with their top aides, including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney. Trump touted the two days of meetings as \\\"productive\\\" and downplayed any deterioration in his personal rapport with the young leader, who he said committed to not carry out any further nuclear or missile tests as negotiations continued. \\\"You always have to be prepared to walk,\\\" Trump said at a press conference.  \\\"I could have 100 percent signed something today.  We actually had papers ready to be signed, but it was not appropriate.  I would rather do it right.  I would rather do it right than fast. \\\"As he prepares to return to major political headwinds back in Washington, Trump dismissed the bombshell testimony of his former personal lawyer Michael Cohen as 'fake' and attacked Democrats for holding the hearing while he was seeking a nuclear agreement. Here's how the day unfolded:3:51 a. m.  (EST) - Trump departs Hanoi, VietnamThe president has departed Hanoi, Vietnam.  He is headed back to the United States, following his second summit with North Korea's leader. \\\"I am about to get on a plane and fly back to a wonderful place called Washington, D. C. , \\\" Trump said, with a hint of sarcasm, at the end of his roughly 40-minute-long press conference. The president was originally scheduled to depart two hours later, but the cancellation of a signing ceremony with Kim moved up the travel schedule. Based on the shift in his schedule, Trump was expected to arrive in Washington late Thursday evening, following a refueling stop at a yet-to-be disclosed location. 2:55 a. m.  (EST) - Trump says he has confronted Kim about Otto Warmbier's death, but believes Kim's denials of responsibilityTrump told reporters in Vietnam that in his meetings with Kim he confronted the leader about Otto Warmbier.  The 21-year-old American student was arrested and imprisoned in North Korea for more than a year.  He died after returning to the U. S.  in a state of unresponsive wakefulness, according to his family. However, the president signaled that he believed Kim didn't share any personal responsibility in Warmbier's death. \\\"I really believe something very bad happened to him and I don't think that the top leadership knew about it,\\\" Trump said.  \\\"I did speak about it and I don't believe that [Kim] would have allowed that to happen.  Just wasn't to his advantage to allow that to happen. \\\"Trump added that Kim \\\"felt badly\\\" about Warmbier's death and described North Korea's prison system -- condemned around the world, by multiple human rights groups, as \\\"rough places. \\\"\\\"You got a lot of people, it's a big country, a lot of people,\\\" Trump said.  \\\"And in those prisons and those camps you have a lot of people and some really bad things happened to Otto, some really, really bad things.  But he tells me he didn't know about it and I will take him at his word. \\\"The White House has said in the past that the talks between Kim and Trump were focused almost solely on denuclearization, rather than the issue of North Korea's human rights record. The moment is likely to stir significant controversy, similar to Trump's statement in Helsinki last year accepting Russian President Vladimir Putin's denials of interference in the 2016 U. S.  election, as well as his acceptance of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's rejection of responsibility for journalist Jamal Khashoggi's murder. 2:49 a. m.  (EST) - Trump downplays breakdown in talks, says Kim told him nuclear testing 'will not start' up againDuring his press conference, the president dismissed the idea that the breakdown of his talks with Kim meant their relationship has soured.  He said Kim has committed to him that nuclear and missile tests will not restart, despite no agreement being reached. \\\"He said the testing will not start,\\\" Trump said.  \\\"He said he is not going to do testing of rockets or missiles or anything having to do with nuclear. \\\"Trump again heaped praise on the young leader, continuing the trend of emphasizing his personal relationship with Kim even amid the stalled talks. \\\"We just like each other,\\\" Trump said.  \\\"We have a good relationship.  It's a totally different system to put it mildly but we like each other. \\\"Trump said a sticking point in the negotiations came over the U. S.  demands that North Korea dismantle its Yongbyon nuclear enrichment facility, which Kim wouldn't agree to unless sanctions were relaxed on the country. \\\"We had to have more than that,\\\" Trump said.  \\\"We brought many points up that I think they were surprised we knew, but we had to do more than just the one level, because if we did the one level and gave up all that leverage that has taken a long time to build. \\\"2:24 a. m.

Speaking before Prime Minister Narendra Modi, he also referred to Islamophobia, hate speech, the “scapegoating” of a community and denial of medical facilities to this community in Pakistan’s “immediate neighbourhood”. Alvi, a close aide of Prime Minister Imran Khan, also highlighted the condition of the Kashmiri people and said their sufferings were compounded by a communications blackout and lack of unfettered access to medical and other essential facilities and high speed internet.  He also criticised what he said were efforts to change the demographic profile of the region.

Adhikari joined the Bharatiya Janata Party in December, defecting from the Trinamool Congress, and his win in Nandigram was one of the few bright spots for the former in an election in which it hoped to win at least 200 seats and unseat Banerjee, but eventually ended up winning only 77. The TMC won 213, and while Banerjee, who lost to Adhikari by a margin of 1,900 votes demanded a recount, this was turned down by the Election Commission. Adhikari, who underwent training at Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) camps in his youth, started his career as a youth Congress leader before joining the TMC in 1998. “As leader of the opposition my first priority will be to carry out a movement to free Bengal of political violence and establish parliamentary democracy.  The killings and arson must stop,” said Adhikari. Also read | 43-member Bengal cabinet takes oathHis reference is to a spate of violence that has swept the state, with TMC workers allegedly targetting the political opposition, primarily the BJP but also Left Front workers. BJP national vice-president Mukul Roy, one of the founder members of the TMC and now a BJP national vice-president, proposed Adhikari’s name for the post of leader of the opposition when the BJP’s newly elected legislators met at the party’s election office at Hastings in south Kolkata on Monday afternoon.  Of the 77 BJP MLAs, 52 were present at the meeting while the rest were in their constituencies in the districts. Since Roy is senior to Adhikari and he won the polls from Krishnanagar in Nadia district, many leaders in the party thought he would be elected leader of the opposition.  But Roy brushed aside the speculations, saying, “I am too old. ” Roy is 67, and Adhikari, 51. “Twenty-two MLAs supported Suvendu Adhikari’s nomination.  I asked the others if they wanted to propose any other name.  Since there was no other nomination, Adhikari was unanimously elected leader of the BJP’s legislative party in the West Bengal assembly,” announced Union minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, who attended the meeting with the BJP’s central election observers. Manoj Tigga, who won the Natabari seat in north Bengal for the second time, was elected the BJP’s chief whip in the assembly. Asked why only 22 of the 52 BJP MLAs supported Adhikari’s nomination, BJP state president Dilip Ghosh said, “He was unanimously elected.  Even those who are in the districts told us that they would accept the party’s decision. ”TMC leaders declined comment on one of their former colleagues becoming leader of the opposition. Kolkata-based political science professor and poll analyst Udayan Bandopadhyay said, “Adhikari joined the BJP five months ago.  His becoming leader of the opposition may demoralise many leaders (in the BJP) who worked hard for years and helped the party grow in Bengal. ”Adhikari became a legislator for the first time in 2006 and was later elected to the Lok Sabha.  He was also made president of the TMC’s youth wing but Banerjee’s nephew Abhishek Banerjee replaced him in 2014.  His younger brother Dibyendu Adhikari is the TMC’s Lok Sabha member from Tamluk.  The youngest sibling, Soumendu, headed the Contai civic body before joining the BJP in January. Polls were held in 292 of Bengal’s 294 assembly seats.  Polls at two seats in Murshidababd district will be held later as two candidates died of Covid-19 during the polls, held in eight phases between March 27 and April 29. \",\n  \"document_ocr\": \"P.\\n\",\n  \"Category\": \"Insufficient_Text\"\n}, {\n  \"Id\": 34958,\n  \"claim_image\": \"http://pbs.twimg.com/media/Exp11WYWgAQMlrq.jpg?format=jpg&name=large\",\n  \"claim\": \"The trial of former Minneapolis Police officer Derek Chauvin starts today, months after George Floyd's death under his knee led to widespread protests.

S.  criminal trial of the COVID-19 era is set to begin, and medical and legal experts said they expect the prosecution of Derek Chauvin for the death of George Floyd to unfold like no other. Fraught with both medical risks and judicial pitfalls for the participants, Minnesota court officials have taken extreme measures to keep the contagion from interfering with the pursuit of justice.  Attempting to COVID-proof the courtroom, officials have installed plexiglass partitions, ripped out the gallery to accommodate social distancing and are requiring the limited number of people allowed in to mask up. Everything from the airflow in the courtroom to the placement of hand sanitizer has been painstakingly detailed in a preparedness plan the Minnesota Judicial Branch has developed.  Even the judge presiding over the case, 61-year-old Peter Cahill, has felt compelled to tell jurors he has received his first COVID-19 vaccine shot. The opening statement's in the case are scheduled for Monday. \\\"It's going to be a case the likes of which none of us have seen before,\\\" David Weinstein, a former federal and state prosecutor in Florida, told ABC News.  \\\"It's a case that's so important on so many levels to so many people from different segments of society. \\\"Despite the COVID precautions being taken in the windowless 18th-floor courtroom of the Hennepin County Government Center in Minneapolis, Dr.  John Brownstein, an epidemiologist and chief innovation officer at Boston Children's Hospital, said the virus can still creep in and wreak havoc. \\\"It's all about balancing risk and there's no such thing as zero risks, but the steps they have taken with social distancing, barriers and masking clearly would drive risks way down,\\\" said Brownstein, a contributor to the ABC News Medical Unit.  \\\"It's definitely a test case for how one can lead trials in a moment of pandemic. \\\"In June, following a three-month COVID-prompted statewide shutdown of the courts, in-person criminal trials began to slowly resume in Hennepin County District Court and others throughout the state under a pilot program.  Administered by the Minnesota Judicial Branch, the program requires courtrooms to be certified for trials by adhering to an extensive COVID-19 Preparedness Plan -- a 13-page document providing guidelines on a plethora of precautions from seating jurors 6 feet apart to placing large-screen monitors in front of the panel to view exhibits, rather than handling them. Safeguards will also alter how private sidebar conferences are usually conducted, having them occur distantly via electronic headsets instead of at the judge's bench, according to the plan. \\\"We are committed to ensuring courts are doing everything we can to make the criminal jury trial experience safe.  As pilots have progressed we have been impressed with the commitment to duty shown by Minnesotans during these turbulent times,\\\" Minnesota Supreme Court Chief Justice Lorie S.  Gildea said in a statement. Minnesota State Public Defender Bill Ward told ABC News that for the most part, the pilot program has shown \\\"the sky has not fallen like, frankly, we all thought it was going to be, about a year ago. \\\"\\\"The biggest concern I had, and I would say most lawyers would have, was working with citizens who were afraid of being seated as jurors,\\\" Ward added.  \\\"If they felt that their safety was at risk due to a lack of spacing, or due to a lack of protection or cleaning of the areas, then they would not feel safe being on a jury. \\\"During the 11-day jury selection phase in the Chauvin case, potential jurors were interviewed individually about their worries over the virus.  After seeing measures taken in the courtroom, most said their concerns were eased by the reconfiguration of the courtroom to protect them. \\\"You can't be too careful,\\\" a prospective juror said. Ward said early results of the pilot program justified potential jurors' fears. \\\"We've had cases where people had symptoms after the trials had begun, where the cases were declared mistrials and had to start over again,\\\" Ward said. The first case tried in Hennepin Country under the pilot program had to be put on pause when the judge was forced to go in quarantine after being exposed to a staff member who tested positive for the virus, the Minneapolis Star Tribune reported. Ward, among the stakeholders who consulted on the courts' COVID-19 Preparedness Plan, said the fear factor still exists despite all the precautions. \\\"What we try to do as lawyers is have the jurors only focus on the case,\\\" Ward said, \\\"but the minute somebody coughs or sneezes, are they worried that they're going to contract the disease?  That became very concerning. \\\"Because of COVID restrictions on access to the courtroom, Cahill has allowed the Chauvin trial to be televised gavel to gavel, which would be the first such time in state history. \\\"The cameras are set up in a way that people can see and have the transparency of what's happening,\\\" Ward said.  \\\"But I think the real test cases are the ones where people aren't watching.  Those are the ones we have to be most concerned about to make sure my clients are being treated fairly and their families are being treated fairly as well. \\\"The case will be live-streamed, but it will not show jurors in order to protect their anonymity. Ward said his office has filed petitions asking the Judicial Branch to prevent counties that don't have courtrooms large enough to accommodate social distancing from using churches as courtrooms. \\\"We fought against that pretty vociferously because of the idea of the separation of church and state and, of course, the backgrounds of the jurors and of the accused,\\\" Ward said. Chauvin is facing charges of second-degree unintentional murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter stemming from Floyd's death on May 25, 2020.  He has pleaded not guilty. Because of concerns over COVID, Cahill ordered that Chauvin be tried separately from his three co-defendants, former Minneapolis police officers J.  Alexander Kueng, Thomas Lane and Tou Thao.  They're charged with aiding and abetting second-degree murder and manslaughter and are scheduled to go on trial in August.  They all have pleaded not guilty. The prosecution's key evidence in the case against all four men is a bystander video of the attempted arrest of Floyd.  Chauvin, who's white, is seen kneeling on the back of Floyd's neck for a prolonged amount of time as the handcuffed and prone Black man repeatedly cried out, \\\"I can't breathe\\\" before going unconscious.  Floyd, 46, initially was accused of trying to use a counterfeit $20 bill to buy cigarettes.  He later died at a hospital. \\\"It is an advantage to the other defendants in this case and a disadvantage to the government,\\\" Weinstein explained, \\\"because now there's less likely to be guilt by association because they're not sitting at the same table.  And the other co-defendants are now given a preview of what the government's case is going to look like. \\\"And if the jury doesn't convict Chauvin, Weinstein added, \\\"well then how in the world is the government going to proceed?  How do you proceed against people you're charging with aiding and abetting? \\\"Because of COVID restrictions, only one member at a time from Floyd's and Chauvin's families will be allowed to sit in the courtroom, and two media representatives will be permitted in to compile pool reports for reporters outside. Fifteen jurors have been picked for the panel, including three alternates.  Initially, the judge and lawyers had agreed to have just two alternates, but on Friday Cahill decided to add an additional alternate juror to ensure there are enough jurors to begin the trial. Cahill said one of the alternates will likely be dismissed on Monday as long as the others show up. Given the continuing COVID-19 crisis, Weinstein questioned whether moving forward with just two alternates will be enough to get through a long trial. \\\"What if during the trial a juror comes down with coronavirus?  With only two alternates that might or might not allow you to keep going,\\\" Weinstein said.  \\\"So now you're going to have to stop the trial for two weeks.  You're going to have to put the brakes on, put everybody into quarantine.  If that happens again, how many times is the judge going to be willing to let this case stop and start, stop and start, stop and start? \\\"As the trial commences, Weinstein said other COVID-related issues are sure to arise, including whether witnesses be allowed to keep their face masks on while testifying. During jury selection, Cahill allowed potential jurors to remove their masks while seated next to him in the witness box with a plexiglass partition between them.  Cahill has not said whether witnesses will be allowed to keep their masks on. \\\"A lot of what happens in a trial is not just the answer, but rather what's telegraphed when you're giving the answer or when you're asking the question,\\\" Weinstein said.  \\\"So if the judge is going to have these proceedings take place where a witness is going to wear a mask, then you're going to lose out on a lot of the way a person's face changes when he or she answers a question. \\\"Weinstein said that such a scenario could create an appellate issue on a confrontation clause by the defense, or at least objections along the lines of, 'Your honor, we object to the mask because it doesn't allow my client to confront, through me, the witness. '\\\"He said Chauvin's attorney, Eric Nelson, might even raise the issue in his closing argument. \\\"If I'm a defense attorney, I'm going to play that, 'Oh, everybody else took off their mask.  This witness didn't.  Don't read anything into it ladies and gentlemen, but did you see how they reacted.  What did they have to hide? '\\\"Ward, the Minnesota public defender, said the issue has come up in the pilot trials. \\\"I actually have a PowerPoint I could show you on different facial expressions that are hidden by masks,\\\" Ward said.  \\\"It is a concern.  The lawyers have made the arguments to allow the witness to lower their masks. \\\"Weinstein said both the prosecution and defense lawyers will be hamstrung when it comes to reading the faces of masked jurors spaced 6 feet apart to glean an indication of how they're reacting to a witness or a specific piece of evidence. During the trial, attorneys have been ordered to stand at a podium with a plexiglass shield attached, restricting lawyers from moving around as they speak. One of the most significant effects COVID will likely have on the trial is whether it will put a crimp on the camaraderie of the jury, especially during deliberations, Weinstein said. \\\"A traditional jury is packed into a jury box, 12 people, two to four alternates, all right on top of each other, all becoming one large family unit as the case progresses.  How is that going to occur in a pandemic when you're going to need to keep people socially distant from each other? \\\" Weinstein said.  \\\"That's going to play into the deliberations, that's going to play into how they're going to interact with each other, how willing they will be to listen to somebody else's opinion. \\\"24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events\",\n  \"document_ocr\": \"Nicholas Pfosi/Reuters\\nMANies\\nLOSED\\nNO JUSTICE\\nNO STREETS GE\\nLIVES\\nHERE\\n\",\n  \"Category\": \"Insufficient_Text\"\n}, {\n  \"Id\": 34959,\n  \"claim_image\": \"https://images.hindustantimes.com/rf/image_size_630x354/HT/p2/2020/08/06/Pictures/ram-mandir-bhoomi-pujan-celebrations_088adbc4-d786-11ea-a162-aa5ffaaa8aa4.jpg\",\n  \"claim\": \"People lit earthen lamps in different parts of the country to celebrate the laying of the foundation stone of the Ram Temple in Ayodhya\\n\\nhttps://t.co/JAy9NhaQPK\",\n  \"claim_ocr\": \"\",\n  \"document_image\": \"http://pbs.twimg.com/media/EcE2sA9U4AAnXLz.jpg?format=jpg&name=large\",\n  \"document\": \"People lit earthen lamps in different parts of the country to celebrate the laying of the foundation stone of the Ram Temple in Ayodhya, as government functionaries, irrespective of political affiliations, termed the event as a “historic moment” for every Indian. There was an air of accomplishment as workers of the Bharatiya Janata Party, the Rashtryia Swayamseval Sangh, and other affiliates of the latter blew conches when Prime Minister Narendra Modi performed ceremonial rituals at the sanctum sanctorum of the makeshift temple and placed a silver brick as the foundation for the new one.  BJP offices in various states were decorated and large screens were installed outside the offices to show the telecast of the ceremony -- carried live by almost every news channel in the country.  Party workers raised Jai Shri Ram and Jai Siya Ram slogansand after the ceremony, ladoos were distributed among people in several statesRam temples across India were done up for the occasion too, with even the streets leading to some in the country’s Hindi heartland decorated; special prayers were held in most.  Rains in several parts of the country including Ayodhya on Wednesday dampened the celebrations but not the sentiments.  In Raj Bhavans (the residence of the governors) in l states such as Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh, earthen lamps were lit and special prayers were held. Rajasthan governor Kalraj Mishra, a former BJP leader from Uttar Pradesh, hosted a recitation of the Sundara Kandam, one of the books of the Ramayan, and Sundarkand with his family members and lit 101 earthen lamps at the Raj Bhawan in Jaipur.  He said the commitment to build the Ram Temple has been fulfilled.  “The temple will be established as a symbol of cultural and national unity and with the spirit of ‘Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam (the world is one family)’. ”Governors of Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand Anandiben Patel and Baby Rani Maurya congratulated the Prime Minister.  “The dream of all Hindu believers has moved towards reality today,” Maurya said. Rajasthan chief minister and Congress leader Ashok Gehlot expressed hope that the temple would become a symbol of unity in the country. “His (Ram’s) life teaches us the importance of truth, justice, equality of all, compassion and brotherhood.  We need to focus on establishing an egalitarian society based on the values espoused by Lord Ram,” Gehlot tweeted.  Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh also tweeted a congratulatory message and said the temple would bring unit and prosperity in the country. West Bengal chief minister, Mamata Banerjee, who ordered complete lockdown in the state on Wednesday, citin the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic said, “Our country has always upheld the age-old legacy of unity in diversity, and we must preserve this to our last breath! ”West Bengal BJP president Dilip Ghosh claimed that several of its workers were arrested when they violated the lockdown restrictions to visit local temples in Bengal.  At Kharagpur in West Midnapore district police resorted to lathi charge after minor clashes with BJP workers.  “Mamata Banerjee is anti-Hindu,” Ghosh added.  Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khatter and Madhya Pradesh CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan termed the day , historic.  “This happy moment is historic for every Indian,” Khatter said; Chouhan added that the “dream of 500 years” has come true. The Ram temple will strengthen peace and humanity in the country, said Assam chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal.  “There was a long and hard struggle for 500 years.  But the power of Indian democratic values, judiciary and executive, under the leadership of PM Modi, has shown the world how solutions to problems can be found peacefully through democratic and constitutional means,” said UP chief minister Yodi Adityanath.

Failure to wear face covering in will attract a fine of 100 pounds under the new rules.  Ministers previously did not encourage masks.  Environment secretary George Eustice said: “It is about managing the overall risk.  Any type of covering will be sufficient for this purpose. ”The Office for National Statistics (ONS), which counts casualties on the basis of condition mentioned in death certificates, said coronavirus figured in 50,548 deaths between December 28 and July 3; of these, England accounted for 48,154 and Wales 2,470. The ONS count differs from that of the Department of Health, which releases figures of deaths and positive cases based on cases in hospitals and care homes.  The ONS count includes deaths from the virus in all settings. The figure of 50,548 does not include the dead in Scotland and Northern Ireland.  On Tuesday, Scotland reported that there were no deaths for six days in a row as the Scottish National Party government in Edinburgh continues its stricter approach to dealing with the pandemic compared to that in England. A new modelling commissioned by chief scientific adviser Patrick Vallance warned that the UK could see about 120,000 new coronavirus deaths in a second wave of infections this winter, the season when the country experiences a rise in hospital admissions and deaths. Experts who were asked to model a reasonable worst-case scenario suggested a range between 24,500 and 251,000 of virus-related deaths in hospitals alone, peaking in January and February, according to their paper released on Tuesday. Stephen Holgate of the University Hospital Southampton NHS Trust, who chaired the report, said: “This is not a prediction - but it is a possibility.  The modelling suggests that deaths could be higher with a new wave of Covid-19 this winter”. “But the risk of this happening could be reduced if we take action immediately,” he added. \",\n  \"document_ocr\": \"Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme (IDSP)\\nmee ite fen\\nPublic Health Department, Maharashtra\\nCOVID-19 Related Updates\\nMedia Bulletin\\nDate - 25th July 2020\\nAt a glance:\\n• 7227 patients discharged today; 2,07,194 COVID-19 patients discharged after full\\nrecovery until today; Recovery rate in the state is 56.55%\\n• 9251 new cases in the state today\\n• 257 COVID-19 deaths reported in the state today.

The justices could, for the first time, establish a standard to decide when politicians go too far in drawing lines for partisan gain, or the court could slam the doors shut on such claims of extreme gerrymandering. \\n\\n  Chief Justice John Roberts suggested at one point that it would be hard for the court to police the use of partisanship in map drawing, when the process is intrinsically political.  Justice Samuel Alito emerged as the most vocal critic of the court’s involvement, often picking apart the manageability of tests that were presented to the court and worrying that every single dispute in the future would have to be resolved by the judiciary.   \\n\\n  Justice Brett Kavanaugh – whose vote could be key – said he would not “dispute” that extreme partisan gerrymandering has become a problem that was especially evident in a map drawn in his home state of Maryland.  But he also questioned if the courts should stay out of the issue because states are reacting with their own initiatives.  \\n\\n  It was a sentiment shared by Justice Neil Gorsuch, who said states have “provided remedies in this area. ” \\n\\nWhere John Roberts is unlikely to compromise\\n\\n  The liberal justices, on the other hand, suggested that they thought that the court could, for the first time, establish a workable standard. \\n\\n  Justice Stephen Breyer, perhaps sensing the reticence of the conservatives, suggested that the court could create a test that would target only those maps that represented what he called “outliers. ” \\n\\n  Such a test, Breyer said, would be “absolutely simple” and rule out the most blatant examples of politicians relying too heavily on party to draw maps.  Justice Elena Kagan said that maps drawn in Maryland were excessive under “any measure. ” \\n\\n  Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, an active participant at oral arguments, worried that under the current system, the impact of an individual’s vote could be “reduced” based on the voter’s party affiliation.  \\n\\n  Critics say that if the court decides to stay out of this issue, it will entrench the power of the party in charge of drawing the lines. \\n\\n  Last term, all eyes were on Justice Anthony Kennedy, who many believed was on the verge – for the first time – of articulating a judicial standard that courts could use going forward.  He was considered the swing vote.  While the conservatives on the bench suggested the issue should be left to the political branches, Kennedy had been unwilling to bar all future claims of injury from partisan gerrymander. \\n\\n  But ultimately the court sidestepped the merits of the cases and Kennedy retired – dashing the hopes of critics of extreme partisan gerrymandering, who thought he might be their last chance to stop politicians from illegally attempting to entrench power for one party over another. \\n\\n  Before the court now are two cases arising from North Carolina and Maryland.  One is brought by Democrats challenging Republican-drawn maps, the other is Republicans challenging a Democratic map.  The lower courts struck the maps and provided the justices with several potential tests grounded in the First Amendment, the Equal Protection Clause and other parts of the Constitution to establish a new standard. \\n\\n  “These cases are really about the representation we get in federal, state and local office all across the country,” said Justin Levitt, a professor of law at Loyola Law School, who has signed a brief in support of the challengers. \\n\\n  Rucho v.  Common Cause was brought by voting rights groups and Democratic voters, among others, who argue that North Carolina’s 2016 congressional districting plan was unconstitutional. \\n\\n  They say the map drawn by Republican legislators amounted to an unconstitutional partisan gerrymander that intentionally diluted the electoral strength of individuals who oppose Republicans.  \\n\\n  Allison Riggs of the Southern Coalition for Social Justice argued in court papers that the map drawers “divided clusters of Democrats that could have anchored congressional districts and submerged the fragments within larger masses of Republicans. ”\\n\\n  Riggs points out that Republicans won 53% of the vote in the 2016 election but they also won 10 of the 13 congressional seats. \\n\\n  Riggs warns the justices that if they don’t step in now, the use of politics will only get worse as map drawers rely increasingly on redistricting software that has become more sophisticated and studies show that the ideological gap between Democrats and Republicans in Congress is larger than ever before. \\n\\n  She said that if the Supreme Court rules that the issue must be left for the political branches, the 2016 plan will be the wave of the future. \\n\\n  “In the 2020 cycle and beyond, both parties will emulate – or exceed – its abuses, openly entrenching themselves in power using the full array of modern mapmaking technologies,” she said. \\n\\n  A lower court ruled in favor of the challengers on equal protection grounds, holding that certain districts discriminated against voters, and that the plan also violated the First Amendment, for punishing individuals based on how they had previously voted. \\n\\n  The other case, Lamone v.  Benisek, arises from Maryland.  A lower court blocked the map, holding that individuals in the district were retaliated against based on how they had voted, in violation of the First Amendment. \\n\\n  This case was brought by seven Republican voters, who argue that Democratic then-Gov.  Martin O’Malley, who was overseeing the redistricting process, took particular aim at the state’s 6th Congressional District.  \\n\\nThe inside story of how John Roberts negotiated to save Obamacare\\n\\n  “To that end, map drawers methodically dismantled the sixth district, breaking apart large swaths of territory dominated by rural Republicans and replacing them with smaller, densely populated areas dominated by suburban Democrats,” their lawyer, Michael Kimberly, argued in court papers. \\n\\n  The officials targeted some 66,000 Republicans in the district and added some 24,000 Democratic voters, therefore swinging the district, according to court documents.  \\n\\n  The challengers pointed to O’Malley’s own statements, when he said it was “also my intent to create a district where the people would be more likely to elect a Democrat than a Republican. ” \\n\\n  The justices should rule on both cases by the end of June. \\n© 2021 Cable News Network.

Breonna Taylor’s family attorney reacts to decisionProtests ignited in Louisville and swept across the U. S.  overnight as Americans unleashed outrage after a Kentucky grand jury indicted one officer for allegedly endangering the neighbors of Breonna Taylor during the police shooting that resulted in her death. Former Louisville officer Brett Hankison was indicted Wednesday on three counts of first-degree wanton endangerment for allegedly endangering Taylor's neighbors when he fired into the apartment complex. The neighboring apartment had three people inside, thus the three charges against Hankison, said Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron.  The other officers involved in Taylor's death were not charged. Taylor family attorney Ben Crump tweeted, \\\"NOTHING for the murder of Breonna Taylor.  This is outrageous and offensive! \\\"The news fueled protests in Louisville, where over 100 were arrested and two officers were shot.  Both officers' injuries were non-life-threatening. Protests, mostly peaceful, spread across the country. In New York City, hundreds of peaceful protesters gathered in Brooklyn and Manhattan. No one was arrested, according to ABC New York station WABC. Protests turned violent in Seattle when protesters violently clashed with authorities. Video captured a police officer who was walking his bicycle walk the bike over a protester who was lying on the ground. That officer has been placed on administrative leave and the incident has been sent to the King County Sheriff’s Office for a potential criminal investigation, said Seattle police. When protesters approached the East Precinct, someone threw an explosive that went through a gate and exploded near bike officers.  A few minutes later, wires that power the security cameras to the precinct were cut, police said. An unlawful assembly was declared after multiple fires were set and explosives were thrown at officers, according to police. \\\"Protestors continue to throw rocks, bottles, and even a fire extinguisher at officers,\\\" the Seattle police said. Multiple officers were injured, including one who was hit with a baseball bat, which cracked his helmet, according to police. Officers \\\"deployed pepper spray and blast balls,\\\" police said. More than a dozen people were arrested with charges ranging from property destruction, resisting arrest and assault on an officer, police said. In Buffalo, New York, a pickup truck hit a protester, authorities said. The victim was not seriously hurt, the Buffalo News reported. The victim was taken to a hospital, according to ABC Buffalo affiliate WKBW. The suspected driver was stopped by police, according to WKBW.  It's unclear whether the protester was hit intentionally. In Washington, D. C. , a crowd gathered at Black Lives Matter Plaza, near the White House. In Atlanta, demonstrators recited Taylor's name and chanted: \\\"What do we want? \\\" \\\"Justice! \\\" When do we want it? \\\" \\\"Now! \\\"After hours of protesting, a crowd headed to the Capitol Building, where Georgia State Patrol Troopers used tear gas to get people to disperse,reported ABC Atlanta affiliate WSB. Some people were arrested. In Denver, a man was detained for driving through a crowd of demonstrators, reported ABC Denver affiliate KMGH.  A protester hit by the car told The Denver Post she was not seriously hurt. Hundreds protested in Chicago, from the South Side to police headquarters. \\\"The grand jury today couldn't even say her name,\\\" said Father Michael Pfleger of St.  Sabina Church, reported ABC Chicago station WLS. \\\"When you take someone's life, it shouldn't matter who it is or who you are.  You should be held accountable,\\\" protester Teyonna Lofton told WLS. \\\"She didn't get the justice that she deserved,\\\" protester Anna Acosta added to WLS. A couch was set on fire in a street and officers put the blaze out, WLS reported. On the streets of Portland, a Molotov cocktail was thrown toward officers, police said. Portland police said an awning outside a precinct was lit on fire and \\\"multiple rocks\\\" were thrown, leaving substantial damage. Demonstrations also broke out in other cities, from Los Angeles to Nashville to Philadelphia. Many protesters across the country chanted \\\"say her name,\\\" a rallying cry to remember 26-year-old Taylor who was shot dead by police while in her Louisville home on March 13. Taylor and her boyfriend, Kenneth Walker, were asleep when three Louisville police officers, including Hankison, tried to execute a \\\"no-knock\\\" search warrant. The officers were investigating a suspected drug operation linked to Taylor's ex-boyfriend.  No drugs were found in the apartment. Walker contends he asked the officers to identify themselves as they tried to break open the door, but got no response, which prompted him to open fire with his licensed gun. Camerson said Detective Myles Cosgrove and Sgt.  Jonathan Mattingly were \\\"justified\\\" when they opened fire 22 times during the incident since they were returning fire. Mattingly was shot in the leg, according to Cameron. Cameron said no shots from Hankison struck Taylor. Hankison was fired and the other officers involved were placed on administrative duty.

Unveiling the new policy at the AP Industrial Infrastructure Corporation, state industries and infrastructure minister Mekapati Goutham Reddy said the core theme of the policy was to provide support to industries across the business value chain – from approvals to setting up industries, supporting their operations and scaling up their business.  The new industrial policy proposes to reimburse state GST to Medium, Large and Mega industrial units generating huge employment for a period of five years, provide special incentives for women entrepreneurs hailing from SC/ST/OBC communities and reserve 16. 2 per cent and 6 per cent of industrial plots for SC and ST entrepreneurs respectively.  The minister said the state government was contemplating establishment of a new initiative called “YSR AP One” by integrating different agencies like industrial development corporation, infrastructure corporation, economic development board and micro, small and medium enterprises corporation etc to extend as many as 10 services for entrepreneurs and industrialists under one roof.  “This new organisation would help entrepreneurs by providing handholding during pre-establishment and setting up of the industrial unit, extending post setup support, ensuring forward and backward linkages and accessing market and new technologies,” the minister said.  The “YSR AP One” will have 10 different wings such as entrepreneurship facilitation cell, market research cell, marketing and branding cell, sales support cell, scheme support cell, business enablement cell, investor reach-out cell, incentive management cell etc. , that would help entrepreneurs in various ways, he said.  The minister further said the state government had identified industrial zoning as a key focus area to ensure planned industrial development and provide a risk-free, investment-friendly environment for setting up and operating industries in the state with minimal impact on the environment.  “Mega industries will be allowed in industrial parks and independent locations as per the environment management plan.  Similarly, the government would develop industrial parks for MSMEs with all the facilities including ready-built factory shells.  The government has also proposed to make changes in the land allotment for industries.  In place of the existing lease and buy model, the government has introduced a composite lease and buy model, in which land is allotted to the industries on lease for a period of 33 years with an option of buying the land after 10 years of successful business operations.  Stating that the manufacturing sector as an employment provider continues to be top priority for the state government, Gautam Reddy said the government would undertake structural reforms to accelerate industrialisation in the state.  “We believe that providing the right facilities at the right cost and offering transparent approvals is critical to the success of the industrial sector,” the minister said.  \",\n  \"document_ocr\": \"\",\n  \"Category\": \"Insufficient_Text\"\n}, {\n  \"Id\": 34964,\n  \"claim_image\": \"http://pbs.twimg.com/media/D0N1qIwWwAAhthR.jpg?format=jpg&name=large\",\n  \"claim\": \"The Oscar for best costume design went to Ruth Carter, and in her own words, it was \\\"a long time coming.\\\" Carter won for \\\"Black Panther\\\" and became the first African American to take home the statue. https://t.co/9KGOWwKBl1 #Oscars https://t.co/LVaMf5Ze4y\",\n  \"claim_ocr\": \"\",\n  \"document_image\": \"http://pbs.twimg.com/tweet_video_thumb/D0No9PhVYAAlFLC.jpg?format=jpg&name=large\",\n  \"document\": \"It was a rocking way to open Hollywood's biggest night. Oscars 2019: 'Bohemian Rhapsody,' 'Green Book' take home multiple awardsFor the first time in three decades, the 2019 Oscars has begun without a host. Usually the show opens with a monologue about current events, politics and of course, the nominees. But instead, Adam Lambert and Queen opened the show with \\\"We Will Rock You,\\\" then moved into another one of their hits, \\\"We Are the Champions. \\\"It was a moment of true chills as Lambert sung the iconic words, \\\"no time for losers\\\" because \\\"We are the champions of the world. \\\"The band had Bradley Cooper, Jennifer Lopez and others singing along and jamming out with them.  The performance closed with a shot of the band's legendary former lead singer Freddie Mercury. \\\"Welcome to the Oscars! \\\" Lambert then shouted. Next, there was a montage of some of the movies of 2018, including \\\"The Favourite,\\\" \\\"Deadpool 2,\\\" \\\"Black Panther,\\\" \\\"Roma,\\\" \\\"Vice\\\" and more. It closed with a voice-over from Mister Rogers from the acclaimed documentary, \\\"Won't You Be My Neighbor. \\\"But the open was not done yet! A comedy dream team of Tina Fey, Amy Poehler and Maya Rudolph stepped out to present outstanding supporting actress. \\\"We are not your hosts, but we are going to stand here a little too long,\\\" Tina Fey joked about the lack of an MC.  \\\"So, that the people who get USA Today tomorrow will think we have hosted. \\\"They gave a mini monologue like a host would have delivered (but instead with three hilarious women) with repeated jokes about not being the hosts for the night, on President Donald Trump's wall and even current events like the Fyre Festival, telling the audience to look under their seats for the infamous cheese sandwich from the failed music event.  Then it was right into the nominees for best supporting actress. Poehler also said of the category that all women are supporting because \\\"women naturally support each other. \\\"Kevin Hart had been named the host of the Oscars back in December, but the funnyman stepped down just hours later, after homophobic tweets he posted almost eight years ago resurfaced. In January, Hart apologized again to the LGBTQ community, adding, \\\"We thought it was OK to talk like that, because that’s how we talked to one another . . .  This is wrong now. \\\"He later said on \\\"GMA\\\" that \\\"There's no more conversation about it . . .  I'm over that, I'm over the moment\\\" when asked about the Oscars and his past comments. Also in February, Hart's good friend Dwayne \\\"The Rock\\\" Johnson said he was offered the gig before Hart, but had to turn it down to shoot a movie. The last time the Oscars went without a host was 1989, when producer Allan Carr decided on having more presenters instead of an MC.  That show had a kitschy open that featured actor Rob Lowe and Snow White singing a duet.  It did not do well with fans and critics. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events\",\n  \"document_ocr\": \"abc\\n\",\n  \"Category\": \"Insufficient_Text\"\n}, {\n  \"Id\": 34965,\n  \"claim_image\": \"http://pbs.twimg.com/media/EuA-ilPVkAgVdPc.jpg?format=jpg&name=large\",\n  \"claim\": \".@MoHFW_INDIA gets fake website charging ₹4K to ₹6K for #COVID19 vaccines blocked\\n\\nhttps://t.co/Pu6uufPfCe https://t.co/Gb9yODxeoO\",\n  \"claim_ocr\": \"as This Website is Fake!\\nA Not secure mohfw.xyz\\nAppointment for vaccination\\nclick to\\nFAKE\\nActve\\nDiacharned\\nAKE\\n\",\n  \"document_image\": \"http://pbs.twimg.com/media/Ez9P-tCUYAQlgSl.png?format=jpg&name=large\",\n  \"document\": \"A fake website impersonating the official website of the ministry of health and family welfare claiming to offer vaccines against Covid-19 has come to the notice of the ministry and it has been immediately blocked to stop the spread of misinformation regarding India's vaccination process.

This is not the first time that fraudulent activities surrounding the vaccination process came to the notice of the authorities.  Before the Co-WIN app was launched, fraudulent apps with the same name cropped up to guile people.  Such activities are likely to pick up pace as India starts to vaccinate people above 50 years as there is an option of self-registration in that phase. The vaccination drive in India began on January 16, starting with healthcare staff and now dovetailing into the phase where other frontline staff are being inoculated.  All these beneficiaries have been pre-registered with the Co-WIN app based on the data provided by the state governments.  For the next phase where people above 50 years of age will be vaccinated, data have been sourced from local authorities and electoral rolls.  But one can also self-register and this leeway is likely to be exploited by fraudsters. \",\n  \"document_ocr\": \"ORDER\\nIn the background of the rising numberof COVID-19 cases and in order to ensure that all\\nCOVID-19 infected patients get due health care , all the private / government hospitals of\\nDistrict Dehradun are hereby ordered to follow the below mentioned Standard Operating\\nProcedure for admission into their facility duly notified as DCCC, DCHC and DCH by the State\\nGovernment.\\nStandard Operating Procedure ( SOP) for admission to be followed\\nA.

Two men died in the country's most populous state of New South Wales (NSW) days after getting their coronavirus vaccine shots, Australian media reported. A 71-year-old man with several underlying health conditions died days after getting AstraZeneca's vaccine, Seven News reported.  A 55-year-old man died eight days after getting his vaccine, a regional newspaper in NSW's northwest town of Tamworth said in a report, citing his family. The reporting of an adverse event after vaccination does not mean it was caused by the doses, TGA said in an emailed reply.  It did not specify when the deaths happened, citing patient confidentiality reasons, or the type of shots they received. Australia's immunisation drive includes AstraZeneca and Pfizer vaccines but earlier this month authorities abandoned a goal to vaccinate its near 26 million population by the end of 2021 after finding possible links between the AstraZeneca vaccine and blood clots. Australia, which had banked on the AstraZeneca vaccine for the majority of its shots, recommended the doses should only be given to people above 50 years, throwing its vaccination programme into disarray. Two weeks ago, the country reported its first death from blood clots linked to the AstraZeneca vaccine after the medicines regulator said a 48-year-old woman's fatality was \\\"likely\\\" linked to the shot. Australia has largely avoided the high COVID-19 numbers seen in other developed countries, with just over 29,700 cases and 910 deaths since the pandemic began, but its vaccination rollout has hit several roadblocks. More than 2 million total vaccine doses have been administered as of Tuesday, far short of the 4 million pledged by the end of March.

Democratic leaders question the conclusiveness of Barr's summary on Mueller reportHouse Democrats on Monday demanded that the Justice Department turn over the full report from special counsel Robert Mueller to Congress by next Tuesday, while also requesting Attorney General William Barr's appearance before lawmakers. The move to escalate the fight over Mueller's findings could be followed with subpoenas, signaling Democrats plans to continue investigations even as President Trump and Republicans have declared victory after Mueller found that the Trump campaign did not conspire with the Kremlin in the 2016 election, according to Barr's summary of Mueller's findings sent to Capitol Hill Sunday. \\\"There are a lot of open questions,\\\" House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif. , said Monday.   “These questions have not been answered by the summary we got from Bill Barr.  I would hope that there are answers in the Mueller report.  Now those answers, I imagine, don’t amount to proof beyond a reasonable doubt of a crime.  But they are concerning nonetheless, particularly as they shed light on whether there is any form of compromise on these individuals. \\\"Their continued focus on the investigations could hurt Democrats politically, following the end of the Mueller investigation, as Republicans continue to accuse them of overreach. \\\"They need to get over it but they won’t get over it,\\\" House Republican Whip Steve Scalise, R-La. , told ABC News.  \\\"They’re still going to keep harassing the president. \\\"Democrats have taken issue with Barr’s obstruction of justice determination, citing a memo that he sent to the Justice Department before his confirmation arguing it would be \\\"fatally misconceived\\\" that Trump's firing of FBI Director James Comey could be the basis of an obstruction of justice inquiry. \\\"His conclusions raise more questions than they answer,\\\" House Judiciary Committee Chairman Rep.  Jerry Nadler, D-N. Y. , said Sunday.  \\\"The American people are entitled to a full accounting of the president's misconduct referenced by the special counsel. \\\"Mueller, according to Barr's summary, did not find that the Trump campaign officials or any associated with it conspired or coordinated with the Russian government to influence the 2016 election.  Barr also revealed Mueller's conclusion on obstruction, that \\\"while this report does not conclude that the president committed a crime, it also doesn't exonerate him,\\\" and said the special counsel set out evidence on \\\"both sides of the question. \\\"\\\"Given Mr.  Barr’s public record of bias against the Special Counsel’s inquiry, he is not a neutral observer and is not in a position to make objective determinations about the report,\\\" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said in a joint statement. Trump and Republicans on Capitol Hill celebrated Mueller's conspiracy conclusion, arguing that it vindicated the president. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif. , said in a statement Sunday that the findings meant  the \\\"case is closed\\\" on the matters investigated by Mueller, a conclusion rejected by Democrats. “This is just the beginning,” Rep.  Eric Swalwell, D-Calif. , a member of the House Judiciary and Intelligence Committees, told ABC News Sunday afternoon.  \\\"It’s case closed criminally but not case closed as to whether the president committed a high crime or misdemeanor. \\\"Rep.  Matt Gaetz, R-Florida, a Trump ally and member of the House Judiciary Committee, argued that Democrats’ focus on the Russia probe would hurt their standing with the public. “We will be able to show that this batch of Democrats that had been telling lies about the president for 22 months, cannot be trusted,” he said, previewing Republicans’ message ahead of the 2020 presidential election.  “They can't be trusted on healthcare, on infrastructure, on education, because they came here to Washington insisting that there was this Russia collusion.  They've spent all their time on that narrative, it's proven to be false. “And I think the American people see who's fighting for them in this president, and who's just trying to create a distraction that ultimately was disproven. ”Nadler and five House Democratic chairs asked the Justice Department for the full Mueller report by next week, and for the underlying evidence to be transmitted to Congress beginning on, April 2.  The House Judiciary Committee has also asked Barr to appear before the panel to testify, according to Judiciary Committee members, who met privately on Monday evening with the committee's special oversight counsels to plot out the path forward. In a statement with Schiff and House Oversight Committee Chairman Elijah Cummings, he said it was \\\"unacceptable that, after Special Counsel Mueller spent 22 months meticulously uncovering this evidence, Attorney General Barr made a decision not to charge the President in under 48 hours,\\\" and did so without interviewing Trump. Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, who also said he wanted Barr to testify, stood by the attorney general’s conclusions on Monday, and said he wanted his committee to investigate the handling of the Russia counterintelligence investigation. The attorney general is also expected to appear before the House Appropriations Committee for a budget hearing on April 9, according to a committee aide, giving Democrats another opportunity to question him about the Mueller investigation.

Dear Chairman Graham, Chairman Nadler, Ranking Member Feinstein, and Ranking Member Collins:As a supplement to the notification provided on Friday, March 22, 2019, I am writing today to advise you of the principal conclusions reached by Special Counsel Robert S.  Mueller III and to inform you about the status of my initial review of the report he has prepared. On Friday, the Special Counsel submitted to me a \\\"confidential report explaining the prosecution or declination decisions\\\" he has reached, as required by 28 C. F. R.  § 600. 8(c).  This report is entitled \\\"Report on the Investigation into Russian Interference in the 2016 Presidential Election. \\\" Although my review is ongoing, I believe that it is in the public interest to describe the report and to summarize the principal conclusions reached by the Special Counsel and the results of his investigation. The report explains that the· Special Counsel and his staff thoroughly investigated allegations that members of the presidential campaign of Donald J.  Trump, and others associated with it, conspired with the Russian government in its efforts to interfere in the 2016 U. S.  presidential election, or sought to obstruct the related federal investigations.  In the report, the Special Counsel noted that, in completing his investigation, he employed 19 lawyers who were assisted by a team of approximately 40 FBI agents, intelligence analysts, forensic accountants, and other professional staff.  The Special Counsel issued more than 2,800 subpoenas, executed nearly 500 search warrants, obtained more than 230 orders for communication records, issued almost 50 orders authorizing use of pen registers, made 13 requests to foreign governments for evidence, and interviewed approximately 500 witnesses. The Special Counsel obtained a number of indictments and convictions of individuals and entities in connection with his investigation, all of which have been publicly disclosed.  During the course of his investigation, the Special Counsel also referred several matters to other offices for further action.  The report does not recommend any further indictments, nor did the Special Counsel obtain any sealed indictments that have yet to be made public.  Below, I summarize the principal conclusions set out in the Special Counsel's report.  AG March 24 2019 Letter to House and Senate Judiciary Committees by ABC News Politics on ScribdRussian Interference in the 2016 U. S.  Presidential Election.  The Special Counsel's report is divided into two parts.  The first describes the results of the Special Counsel's investigation into Russia's interference in the 2016 U. S.  presidential election.  The report outlines the Russian effort to influence the election and documents crimes committed by persons associated with the Russian government in connection with those efforts.  The report further explains that a primary consideration for the Special Counsel's investigation was whether any Americans -including individuals associated with the Trump campaign - joined the Russian conspiracies to influence the election, which would be a federal crime.  The Special Counsel's investigation did not find that the Trump campaign or anyone associated with it conspired or coordinated with Russia in its efforts to influence the 2016 U. S.  presidential election.  As the report states: \\\"[T]he investigation did not establish that members of the Trump Campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities. \\\"[Footnote from letter: In assessing potential conspiracy charges, the Special Counsel also considered whether members of the Trump campaign \\\"coordinated\\\" with Russian election interference activities.  The Special Counsel defined \\\"coordination\\\" as an \\\"agreement-tacit or express-between the Trump Campaign and the Russian government on election interference. \\\"]The Special Counsel's investigation determined that there were two main Russian efforts to influence the 2016 election.  The first involved attempts by a Russian organization, the Internet Research Agency (IRA), to conduct disinformation and social media operations in the United States designed to sow social discord, eventually with the aim of interfering with the election.  As noted above, the Special Counsel did not find that any U. S.  person or Trump campaign official or associate conspired or knowingly coordinated with the IRA in its efforts, although the Special Counsel brought criminal charges against a number of Russian nationals and entities in connection with these activities. The second element involved the Russian government's efforts to conduct computer hacking operations designed to gather and disseminate information to influence the election.  The Special Counsel found that Russian government actors successfully hacked into computers and obtained emails from persons affiliated with the Clinton campaign and Democratic Party organizations, and publicly disseminated those materials through various intermediaries, including WikiLeaks.  Based on these activities, the Special Counsel brought criminal charges against a number of Russian military officers for conspiring to hack into computers in the United States for purposes of influencing the election.  But as noted above, the Special Counsel did not find that the Trump campaign, or anyone associated with it, conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in these efforts, despite multiple.  offers from Russian-affiliated individuals to assist the Trump campaign. Obstruction of Justice.  The report's second part addresses a number of actions by the President - most of which have been the subject of public reporting - that the Special Counsel investigated as potentially raising obstruction-of-justice concerns.  After making a \\\"thorough factual investigation\\\" into these matters, the Special Counsel considered whether to evaluate the conduct under Department standards governing prosecution and declination decisions but ultimately determined not to make a traditional prosecutorial judgment.  The Special Counsel therefore did not draw a conclusion - one way or the other - as to whether the examined conduct constituted obstruction.  Instead, for each of the relevant actions investigated, the report sets out evidence on both sides of the question and leaves unresolved what the Special Counsel views as \\\"difficult issues\\\" of law and fact concerning whether the President's actions and intent could be viewed as obstruction . .  The Special Counsel states that \\\"while this report does not conclude that the President committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him. \\\"The Special Counsel's decision to describe the facts of his obstruction investigation without reaching any legal conclusions leaves itto the Attorney General to determine whether the conduct described in the report constitutes a crime.  Over the course of the investigation, the Special Counsel's office engaged in discussions with certain Department officials regarding many of the legal and factual matters at issue in the Special Counsel's obstruction investigation.  After reviewing the Special Counsel's final report on these issues; consulting with Department officials, including the Office of Legal Counsel; and applying the principles of federal prosecution that guide our charging decisions, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and I have concluded that the evidence developed during the Special Counsel's investigation is not sufficient to establish that the President committed an obstruction-of-justice offense.  Our determination was made without regard to, and is not based on, the constitutional considerations that surround the indictment and criminal prosecution of a sitting president. [Footnote from letter:  See A Sitting President's Amenability to Indictment and Criminal Prosecution, 24 Op.  O. L. C.  222 (2000). ]In making this determination, we noted that the Special Counsel recognized that \\\"the evidence does not establish that the President was involved in an underlying crime related to Russian election interference,\\\" and that, while not determinative, the absence of such evidence bears upon the President's intent with respect to obstruction.  Generally speaking, to obtain and sustain an obstruction conviction, the government would need to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that a person, acting with corrupt intent, engaged in obstructive conduct with a sufficient nexus to a pending or contemplated proceeding.  In cataloguing the President's actions, many of which took place in public view, the report identifies no actions that, in our judgment, constitute obstructive conduct, had a nexus to a pending or contemplated proceeding, and were done with corrupt intent, each of which, under the Department's principles of federal prosecution guiding charging decisions, would need to be proven beyond a reasonable doubt to establish an obstruction-of¬justice offense. 37,040-41 (July 9, 1999).  As I have previously stated, however, I am mindful of the public interest in this matter.  For that reason, my goal and intent is to release as much of the Special Counsel's report as I can consistent with applicable law, regulations, and Departmental policies. Based on my discussions with the Special Counsel and my initial review, it is apparent that the report contains material that is or could be subject to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 6( e ), which imposes restrictions on the use and disclosure of information relating to \\\"matter[ s] occurring before [a] grand jury. \\\" Fed.  R.  Crim.  P.  6(e)(2)(B).  Rule 6(e) generally limits disclosure of certain grand jury information in a criminal investigation and prosecution.  Id.  Disclosure of 6( e) material beyond the strict limits set forth in the rule is a crime in certain circumstances.  See, e. g. , 18 U. S. C.  § 401(3).  This restriction protects the integrity of grand jury proceedings and ensures that the unique and invaluable investigative powers of a grand jury are used strictly for their intended criminal justice function. Given these restrictions, the schedule for processing the report depends in part on how quickly the Department can identify the 6( e) material that by law cannot be made public.  I have requested the assistance of the Special Counsel in identifying all 6( e) information contained in the report as quickly as possible.  Separately, I also must identify any information that could impact other ongoing matters, including those that the Special Counsel has referred to other offices.  As soon as that process is complete, I will be in a position to move forward expeditiously in determining what can be released in light of applicable law, regulations, and Departmental policies. As I observed in my initial notification, the Special Counsel regulations provide that \\\"the Attorney General may determine that public release of' notifications to your respective Committees \\\"would be in the public interest. \\\" 28 C. F. R.  § 600. 9(c).  I have so determined, and I will disclose this letter to the public after delivering it to you. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events\",\n  \"document_ocr\": \"The Attorney General\\nWashington, D.C.\\nMarch 24, 2019\\nThe Honorable Jerrold Nadler\\nThe Honorable Lindsey Graham\\nChairman, Committee on the Judiciary\\nChairman, Committee on the Judiciary\\nUnited States House of Representatives\\n2132 Rayburn House Office Building\\nWashington, D.C. 20515\\nUnited States Senate\\n290 Russell Senate Office Building\\nWashington, D.C. 20510\\nThe Honorable Doug Collins\\nRanking Member, Committee on the Judiciary\\nUnited States House of Representatives\\n1504 Longworth House Office Building\\nWashington, D.C. 20515\\nThe Honorable Dianne Feinstein\\nRanking Member, Committee on the Judiciary\\nUnited States Senate\\n331 Hart Senate Office Building\\nWashington, D.C. 20510\\nDear Chairman Graham, Chairman Nadler, Ranking Member Feinstein, and Ranking Member\\nCollins:\\nAs a supplement to the notification provided on Friday, March 22, 2019, I am writing today\\nto advise you of the principal conclusions reached by Special Counsel Robert S.

Remembering Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader GinsburgThree days of public mourning for Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, a champion of equality and pioneer of women's rights, began Wednesday when her casket arrived at the Supreme Court for a dramatic procession up the steps lined by more than a hundred of her former law clerks. Her casket was placed on the Lincoln Catafalque, once used for President Abraham Lincoln, before a ceremony inside the court's Great Hall attended by family, friends and her fellow justices, all wearing masks. Chief Justice John Roberts spoke, calling her a \\\"fighter\\\" for equal justice and saying \\\"her voice was soft, but when she spoke, people listened. \\\"Roberts, who sat next to Ginsburg on the Supreme Court bench, said her life was a reflection of the American Dream, noted her love of opera and called her \\\"a star\\\" who \\\"found her stage in our courtroom. \\\"One of her \\\"many virtues\\\" that defined her time on the bench, he said, was her \\\"humility. \\\"\\\"The court was her family, too.  This building was her home,\\\" he said.  \\\"Ruth is gone and we grieve. \\\"\\\"May she rest in peace,\\\" Roberts said, standing in front of a portrait of Ginsburg. Then, in an unprecedented move, because of the pandemic, her casket was brought outside and placed at the top of the court steps under the portico so members of the public could pay their respects. There has been an outpouring of public support at the court since word of Ginsburg's death at age 87 came Friday night.  With warm, sunny weather in Washington on Wednesday, large crowds were expected. Some of those who came to honor her wore \\\"Notorious RBG\\\" shirts, the nickname she became known by to her devoted supporters. Many who gazed at her flag-draped casket from the bottom of the court steps were women and girls. Mourners had started to gather early Wednesday morning near the court steps, where there had been a makeshift memorial of flowers and messages in remembrance of the impact she has had on people's lives in her almost 30 years as a liberal icon on the nation's high court. The memorial, which wrapped around the building, was cleared away overnight -- some was collected by the court curator and other items were donated to Ginsburg's family or interested museums. Ginsburg will lie in repose at the Supreme Court through Thursday.  The public outdoor viewings continue Wednesday until 10 p. m.  and resume Thursday from 9 a. m.  until 10 p. m. The White House announced that President Donald Trump would go to the court Thursday to pay his respects. Among those paying their respects on Wednesday were Vice President Mike Pence, second lady Karen Pence, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and former President Bill Clinton -- who nominated Ginsburg to the bench in 1993. On Friday, Ginsburg will lie in state at the Capitol, the first woman in U. S.  history to be so honored, at the direction of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Nearby in the Capitol, a bitter political battle continued over her replacement. She will be interred next week beside her husband of 56 years at Arlington National Cemetery.

A fireworks display lit up the sky above the Washington Monument at the conclusion of his remarks. Highlights from the final night of the RNC:12:48 a. m.  Trump squares off with his own America as GOP convention concludes: ANALYSISOn the final night of the Republican National Convention, as protesters massed outside the White House that was transformed into a grand political backdrop, President Donald Trump offered a sentiment the nation actually can unite behind. \\\"At no time before have voters faced a clearer choice between two parties, two visions, two philosophies or two agendas,\\\" the president said Thursday, in accepting the Republican nomination for a second time with a meandering and searing speech. It would have been a jarring scene in any moment -- bright lights and big \\\"TRUMP-PENCE\\\" signs on the South Lawn of the White House, as a giant political rally was held at the most famous residence in the United States. The messaging, too, would be discordant in any time -- descriptions of American rot and violence joined by urgent pleas to reelect the president. But this is not just any moment.  It's a tense, angry, conflicted time, amid the biggest pandemic and most sudden economic collapse in a century, and unfolding reckonings around race and policing. Read more from ABC News Political Director Rick Klein's analysis:12:44 a. m.  3 key takeaways from night 4 of the Republican National ConventionThe Republican National Convention came to a close Thursday, but not before remarks from some of the nation's most prominent conservatives, including the party's congressional leaders, President Donald Trump's daughter -- and White House adviser -- and the chief executive himself. The night brought a close to two weeks of unprecedented political conventions but also kick started the presidential campaign's homestretch, reaffirming several of the themes likely to play a major role in the successes and failures of those on the ballot in November. Here are the key takeaways from night four of the RNC:12:37 a. m.  Unprecedented wave of GOP defections as Trump re-nominated: ANALYSISWhat started as a trickle of \\\"Never Trumpers\\\" has turned into a historic wave of defections from high-profile Republicans. By the close of the 2020 Republican National Convention, nearly 500 current and former GOP officials have gone public opposing a second term for the president of their own party. \\\"Absolutely unprecedented; nothing remotely like it,\\\" said presidential historian Mark Updegrove. The divide over President Donald Trump and Trumpism has raised existential questions for Republicans both about party identity and loyalty. \\\"It's become the party of Donald Trump and any whim he has,\\\" Updegrove said.  \\\"It's about personality and not political party or platform. \\\"While nine in 10 Republican voters approve of Trump as president, opposition to his leadership inside the party establishment has mushroomed.

The striking contrast between the Democratic and Republican conventionsAfter testing every staff member, reporter and individual near the former vice president for two days in a row and asking members of the crowd to stay in or near their socially distanced cars Joe Biden and his wife still wore masks as they watched fireworks together, away from the cheering audience after his acceptance speech at the Democratic National Convention in Delaware last week. In terms of their approach to coronavirus safety, Democrats and Republicans have largely followed different standards, resulting in strikingly different images over the course of their two conventions. On the third night of the Republican National Convention, for instance, President Trump and Vice President Mike Pence stepped down from the stage at the Fort McHenry National Monument and greeted the crowd of a few hundred supporters.  While they did not shake everyone's hands, they did not wear masks.  Pence could be seen giving a fist-bump to at least one member of the crowd. The conventions were, in many ways, a culmination of diverging views and campaigning norms that had been on display for the two parties for months.   did not wear masks.  Pence could be seen giving a fist-bump to at least one member of the crowd. Read more:-- ABC News Deputy Political Director MaryAlice Parks12:21 a. m.  Biden responds to Trump's acceptance speechThe Biden campaign is once again criticizing Trump on the coronavirus pandemic, tallying the number of Americans lost to COVID-19 over the four days of the RNC and deriding Trump for delivering “a delusional vision” of the country, rather than articulating his vision for dealing with the pandemic -- something Biden’s Deputy Campaign Manager Kate Bedingfield said would not come as a surprise to the American people. “Since the beginning of the Republican convention, at least 3,525 Americans have lost their lives to the coronavirus.  Over those four days -- and for the last eight months -- the American people have waited in exasperation for a plan to finally take control of the pandemic that has cost us 180,000 lives, infected almost six million, and thrown working families and our middle class into dire financial straits, but nothing came,” Bedingfield wrote in the statement. “Instead of a strategy to overcome the pandemic, or any concern for the unbearable suffering in our country right now as a result of his ongoing failures, what we heard was a delusional vision completely divorced from the crushing reality that ordinary Americans face.  But the American people know who Donald Trump is.  They know the truth about Trump’s crisis-plagued presidency because they are living it every single day: shuttered businesses in our neighborhoods, kids kept home from school, and a steady stream of vitriol intended to tear us apart, from the person who is supposed to be uniting our nation. \\\"--ABC News' Molly Nagle11:44 p. m.  Fireworks display at the Washington MonumentAt the conclusion of Trump's acceptance speech, a fireworks display launched at the Washington Monument. 11:43 p. m.  'I'm here and they're not' Trump highlights White House as backdrop at RNCTrump made a point to emphasize that he was in the White House, and physically outside it, in making a contrast between him and Biden. \\\"We must turn the page forever on this failed political class.  The fact is, I'm here,\\\" Trump said, turning and pointing at the White House, \\\"the fact is, we're here and they're not.  And that's because of you. \\\"The use of the White House for the convention event has raised ethical concerns, including that it could violate a federal law that bans government employees from using their office for political activity or personal gain.  The president and vice president are exempt from that law -- the Hatch Act -- but the RNC events at the White House and National Park Service properties still garnered criticism it blurred the lines for other administration employees involved in the events. The Hatch Act is intended to prevent abuses of power, bribery and coercion by officials in public office. Multiple Trump administration officials, including counselor to the president Kellyanne Conway, have been cited for repeated and knowing violations of the Hatch Act, but enforcement of violations is left to the individual's employer and no action has been taken in those cases. -- ABC News' Stephanie Ebbs11:35 p. m.  Trump says election a choice between law and order and \\\"mob rule\\\"Trump pledged support for law enforcement around the country, saying the overwhelming majority of officers are noble and courageous but afraid to act. Trump repeated a theme from throughout the night that Democrat-run cities are violent and dangerous.  And similar to Vice President Mike Pence, Trump mentioned the protests in Kenosha, Wisconsin, without mentioning Jacob Blake, the Black man who was shot in the back by police and paralyzed, or the protesters who were shot and killed. \\\"When there is police misconduct, the justice system must hold wrongdoers fully and completely accountable, and it will.  But what we can never have in America -- and must never allow -- is mob rule.  In the strongest possible terms, the Republican Party condemns the rioting, looting, arson and violence we have seen in Democrat-run cities like Kenosha, Minneapolis, Portland, Chicago, and New York,\\\" he said. \\\"There is violence and danger in the streets of many Democrat-run cities throughout America.  This problem could easily be fixed if they wanted to.  We must always have law and order.  All federal crimes are being investigated, prosecuted and punished to the fullest extent of the law. \\\"Trump pledged to protect \\\"security, dignity, and peace. \\\"\\\"If the Democrat Party wants to stand with anarchists, agitators, rioters, looters, and flag-burners, that is up to them, but I, as your President, will not be a part of it.  The Republican Party will remain the voice of the patriotic heroes who keep America Safe. \\\"-- ABC News' Stephanie Ebbs 11:04 p. m.  Trump hits highlights of 2016 campaign promisesTrump hit on several policy areas that were a big feature of his 2016 campaign -- supporting American energy independence and withdrawing from the Paris climate agreement, standing up to China, renegotiating trade agreements with Canada and Mexico and harsher immigration policies, among others. And he used the issue of China to bring his remarks back to the pandemic, claiming wins on the U. S.  testing system, treatments like convalescent plasma that was recently granted emergency authorization by the FDA,  and a low fatality rate in the U. S. And he specifically pointed to Biden's approach to the pandemic response as worse for the country, saying it would have caused more deaths without the initial travel ban from China and causing families more harm if there were more shutdowns across the country. \\\"Instead of following the science, Joe Biden wants to inflict a painful shutdown on the entire country.  His shutdown would inflict unthinkable and lasting harm on our nation's children, families and citizens of all backgrounds,\\\" Trump said. \\\"The cost of the Biden shutdown would be measured in increased drug overdoses, depression, alcohol addiction, suicides, heart attacks, economic devastation and more.  Joe Biden's plan is not a solution to the virus, but rather a surrender. \\\"And Trump again brought up the efforts to make a vaccine available in \\\"record time\\\" with Operation Warp Speed, saying \\\"We will have a safe and effective vaccine this year, and together we will crush the virus. \\\"-- ABC News' Stephanie Ebbs10:54 p. m.  Trump calls Biden 'destroyer of American greatness'Trump portrayed Republicans and Democrats as opposed in their view of the \\\"American way of life,\\\" saying Democrats can't improve the country if they're intent on criticizing it.  He said this election is the most important in the history of the country. \\\"At no time before have voters faced a clearer choice between two parties, two visions, two philosophies or two agendas.  This election will decide whether we SAVE the American Dream, or whether we allow a socialist agenda to DEMOLISH our cherished destiny,\\\" he said. Trump called Joe Biden the \\\"destroyer of American greatness and that he voted against the best interest of blue collar workers while Trump has kept his campaign promises. \\\"At the Democrat National Convention, Joe Biden and his party repeatedly assailed America as a land of racial, economic and social injustice.  So tonight, I ask you a very simple question: How can the Democrat Party ask to lead our country when it spends so much time tearing down our country? \\\" Trump asked. \\\"In the left's backward view, they do not see America as the most free, just, and exceptional nation on earth.  Instead, they see a wicked nation that must be. \\\"-- ABC News' Stephanie Ebbs10:43 p. m.  Trump promises vaccine before the end of the yearIn addressing the ongoing coronavirus pandemic Trump said the country has been struck by a powerful and invisible enemy, but promised the country would meet the challenge and produce a vaccine before the end of the year. \\\"We are delivering lifesaving therapies, and will produce a vaccine BEFORE the end of the year, or maybe even sooner!  We will defeat the virus, end the pandemic and emerge stronger than ever before,\\\" he said. Public health experts have raised concerns about politicizing the process of approving and distributing a vaccine, saying any perception that the process was rushed to help Trump in the election could reduce trust and make people reluctant to take the vaccine, even though scientists involved in the process say it has been a completely scientific process. Experts like Dr.  Anthony Fauci have also said that it could take many months after a vaccine is produced before it is made available to most of the public. -- ABC News' Stephanie Ebbs10:41 p. m.  Trump to visit area impacted by Hurricane Laura President Trump says he plans to visit areas of Texas and Louisiana impacted by Hurricane Laura this weekend. \\\"Our thoughts are with the wonderful people who have just come through the wrath of Hurricane Laura.  We are working closely with state and local officials in Texas, Louisiana, Arkansas, Mississippi -- sparing no effort to save lives,\\\" he said at the beginning of his speech. \\\"While the hurricane was fierce, one of the strongest to make landfall in 150 years, the casualties and damage were far less than thought possible, only 24 hours ago.  And this is due to the great work of FEMA, law enforcement and the individual states.  I will be going this weekend.  And congratulations.  Thank you for that great job out there.  We really appreciate it. \\\"Earlier in the day during a visit to FEMA headquarters Trump said he considered delaying the speech until Monday to visit the area. -- ABC News' Stephanie Ebbs10:38 p. m.  Protesters outside White House chant 'vote him out'As the president delivers his acceptance speech at the White House, protesters nearby are chanting \\\"vote him out. \\\"Fences once again separate the people from The People's House. In a summer of unrest -- tense clashes between police and demonstrators have become a familiar sight. But Thursday night some protesters, like Ariana Evans, expressed their exhaustion. ABC News met the first-time demonstrator in May after the killing of George Floyd while in police custody.  On her megaphone, she would step in between violent clashes calling for demonstrations to be peaceful. She's protested every day since Floyd's death -- 94 days total. Now she's losing hope, no longer pushing for peace. \\\"They showed us that it doesn't matter how peaceful you are.  Doesn't matter if you comply.  Doesn't matter.  They will shoot you in the back in front of your kids. \\\"ABC News Senior congressional correspondent Mary Bruce reported hearing the faint music and pounding sounds from the protesters as the president speaks.  No specific chanting could be heard, she said, but an unmistakable din. -- ABC News' Rachel Scott10:31 p. m.  Trump accepts the nomination from the GOP\\\"I profoundly accept this nomination for President of the United States,\\\" Trump said shortly after beginning his remarks. 10:26 p. m.  'Washington has not changed Donald Trump.  Donald Trump has changed Washington:' Ivanka TrumpIvanka Trump made an impassioned pitch for her father's reelection, arguing that he will continue to stick with his ideas as the same candidate who won the election in 2016. She said he has \\\"strong convictions\\\" and makes his opinions known, even acknowledging that his communication style is \\\"not to everyone's taste\\\" and that his tweets can \\\"feel a bit unfiltered. \\\"\\\"But the results, the results speak for themselves.  He is so unapologetic about his beliefs that he has caused me and countless Americans to take a hard look at our own convictions and ask ourselves, what do we stand for?  What kind of America do we want to leave for our children?  I am more certain than ever before we want a future where our kids can believe in American greatness,\\\" she said. She then delivered a list of what she called the administration's successes, including the tax cut and reform bill, child care tax credits, reducing the cost of prescription drugs, and criminal justice reform where she said he was able to build bipartisan consensus -- the only mention of bipartisanship of the night. And she referred back to the 2016 campaign and the pitch that Trump is not a typical politician and will now repeat mistakes by past leaders. \\\"Four years ago, I told you I would fight alongside my father and, four years later, here I am.  Many of the issues my father has championed are not historically Republican priorities.  Yet, where Washington chooses sides, our president chooses common sense.  Where politicians choose party, our president chooses people,\\\" she said. \\\"For the first time in a long time we have a president who has called out Washington's hypocrisy, and they hate him for it,\\\" she added. \\\"Dad, people attack you for being unconventional.  But I love you for being real and I respect you for being effective.  Our president refuses to surrender his beliefs to score point with the political elite.  To my father, you are the elite.  You are the only people he cares about scoring points with.  If these problems were easy to solve, previous presidents would have done so.  But you don't achieve different results by doing things the same way. \\\"-- ABC News' Stephanie Ebbs 10:13 p. m.  Ivanka Trump introduces her father at the White HouseIvanka Trump is introducing her father to the audience at the White House. \\\"Tonight I stand before you as the proud daughter of the people's president,\\\" she said.  \\\"He is our commander-in-chief, champion of the American worker, defender of common sense and our voice for the forgotten men and women of this country. \\\"10:08 p. m.  Republican messages evoke images of violence, similar to 2016 campaignAnalysts at FiveThirtyEight note the parallels between the messages around violence in the RNC and the images of violence referenced by Trump during the 2016 campaign and his inaugural address. A recent Pew survey found that 59% of Americans say violent crime will be \\\"very important\\\" to their vote -- almost the same share as who cite the coronavirus outbreak.  So it might not be Americans' most important problem, but it does seem to be on people's radar. And FiveThirtyEight has reported that even crime has actually been on the decline over the last 30 years, even though many Americans believe it has gone up in part because of the rhetoric from politicians. Shootings and crime are up in New York City and other cities this year but overall crime is down, senior writer Amelia Thomson-DeVeaux notes, adding that it's too early to know if that's a long-term trend or an anomaly. And politics editor Sarah Frostenson notes the focus on crime in New York City and Mayor Bill de Blasio is part of a broader point to attack Democratic mayors, governors and politicians as ineffective. 10:07 p. m Muellers talk about death of their daughter, Trump's responseCarl and Marsha Mueller described the tragedy of the death of their daughter at the hands of the Islamic state and said they appreciated the president going after ISIS the way he did and the military service members who killed Abu Bakr al-Baghdad. \\\"Carl and I support Donald Trump because of his commitment to make and keep America great,\\\" said Marsha Mueller, \\\"with the passion of people like Kayla … Americans who don't just talk, they act.  That was our daughter, that's President Trump. \\\"10:04 p. m.  Multiple speakers highlight law enforcementMultiple speakers during the final night of the RNC highlighted President Trump's support for law enforcement and criminal justice reform, a contrast to the Democrats' focus on racial justice last week. Alice Johnson, a 63-year-old woman whose life sentence was commuted by Trump after advocacy from Kim Kardashian West, talked about his support for criminal justice reform through the First Step Act. \\\"When President Trump heard about me -- about the injustice of my story -- he saw me as a person.  He had compassion.  And he acted.  Free in body thanks to President Trump.  But free in mind thanks to the almighty God,\\\" Johnson said in her remarks. The RNC also featured an emotional story from Ann Dorn, whose husband David Dorn, a 77-year-old retired police officer, was killed attempting to stop looters from breaking into a pawn shop during protests in St.  Louis earlier this summer. \\\"I re-live that horror in my mind every single day.   My hope is that having you re-live it with me now will help shake this country from the nightmare we are witnessing in our cities and bring about positive, peaceful change,\\\" she said. Dorn went on to say that Trump support providing more resources to law enforcement. \\\"Violence and destruction are not legitimate forms of protest.  They do not safeguard Black lives.  They only destroy them.  President Trump understands this, (and) has offered federal help to restore order in our communities.  In a time when police departments are short on resources and manpower, we need that help,\\\" she said. Before Ann Dorn's speech was aired, her appearance and use of the officer's death as a way to praise Trump had already sparked outrage from David Dorn's children.  The officer's daughters, Debra White and Lisa Dorn, told the St.  Louis American on Wednesday that their father was a registered Democrat and didn't support Trump. White told the paper that her father opposed much of Trump's rhetoric and policies including \\\"the things he said about Colin Kaepernick, the kids locked up in cages, the racist remarks. \\\"Both daughters said they called Ann Dorn and asked her not to speak about their father at the convention. \\\"She can be a Trump supporter in her own right, but she should not politicize our father's death for Trump's agenda,\\\" Lisa Dorn said. And Pat Lynch, president of the Police Benevolent Association, said law enforcement is \\\"staring down the barrel\\\" of a public safety disaster and criticized Democrats for a lack of support. \\\"Unlike the Democrats, who froze in the face of rioting and looting, President Trump gives law enforcement the support and tools to put a stop to it -- period, end of story. \\\"-- ABC News' Terrence Smith and Ivan Pereira10:01 p. m.  Sen.  Tom Cotton references athletes who kneel during anthemA day after professional athletes and associations postponed games -- and some followed suit Thursday -- Sen.  Tom Cotton referenced an ongoing debate about players kneeling during the national anthem to call attention to the issues of racial inequality and police brutality. \\\"We need a president who stands up for America — not one who takes a knee,\\\" he said.  \\\"A strong and proud America is a safe America. \\\"9:54 p. m.  Giuliani warns Democrats will 'do to America' what they did in New YorkRudy Giuliani, former New York City mayor and personal attorney to the president, asked viewers not to let \\\"Democrats do to America what they have done to New York. \\\"\\\"These continuous riots in Democratic cities give you a good view of the future under Biden,\\\" he said.  \\\"It is clear that a vote for Biden and the Democrats creates the risk that you will bring this lawlessness to your city. \\\"9:49 p. m.  Ben Carson defends Trump on issues of raceHousing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson, the highest ranking African American in the Trump administration, defended the president from accusations that his comments and policies are racist. Carson said Trump's policies support economic success for everyone, citing his policies on criminal justice reform, funding for historically black colleges and universities, school choice and programs to bring investment to disadvantaged areas. \\\"President Trump does not dabble in identity politics.  He wants everyone to succeed and believes in the adage \\\"a rising tide lifts all boats. \\\" Many on the other side love to incite division by claiming that president trump is a racist.  They could not be more wrong,\\\" he said. 9:45 p. m.  Wisconsin politicians react to Trump's expected comments on Jacob Blake protestsThere are very different reactions from political party leaders on the ground in Wisconsin to the news that Trump is expected to address the police shooting and protests in Kenosha. Wisconsin Republican Chair Andrew Hitt welcomed Trump's comments, saying federal presence has already been helpful to \\\"bring order to the chaos. \\\"There have been more than 200 agents and marshals from the FBI, ATF and USMS who have been deployed to Kenosha. \\\"The inaction of our Democratic governor and attorney general led to Wisconsinites waking up to images of Kenosha burning multiple times this week.  President Trump stepped in to help bring order to the chaos and Wisconsinites are grateful,\\\" said Hitt, who will be at the White House the president's acceptance speech. Democrats denounced the reaction from Trump, noting that Pence will no longer be speaking at a Wisconsin college commencement and saying Trump's words will only bring more division. \\\"Under Trump and Pence's failed leadership, our country is in the midst of three national crises: the economic recession, a global pandemic, and a social justice crisis that is disproportionately impacting communities of color.  His administration has done nothing but sow hate and division, and there is an absolute void of leadership at a time when Wisconsinites need it the most.  As the state works to heal, it's clear why Pence was dis-invited from speaking at Wisconsin Lutheran College's commencement: the Trump administration is focused on dividing, not uniting,\\\" said Chris Walton, chair of the Milwaukee Dems. -- ABC News' Cheyenne Haslett9:32 p. m.  Ben Carson addresses Blake familyIn the first reference to Jacob Blake on Thursday -- and the second during the entire RNC -- Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson said \\\"our hearts go out the Blake family. \\\"\\\"As Jacob's mother has urged the country, let's use our hearts, our love and our intelligence to work together to show the rest of the world how humans are supposed to treat each other. \\\"9:28 p. m.  Claims of Trump's economic wins lack contextMultiple speakers Thursday night praised President Trump for the growth of the U. S.  economy and said it was important he stay in office to keep the economy successful. Dan Scavino, White House deputy chief of staff for communications and director of social media, said, \\\"Just think about what we achieved together with President Trump.  The strongest economy in history.  The lowest unemployment rate for almost all demographic groups -- Black Americans, Hispanic Americans, women, and so many more. \\\"But the strong performance of the economy under Trump before the coronavirus, was -- by many metrics -- a continuation of growth that began under President Barack Obama. Pre-pandemic declines in unemployment that led to record-low levels of African American and Hispanic unemployment under Trump began during the Obama administration. The same goes for the women's unemployment rate -- which reached a 10-year low under Obama, before dropping under Trump. The U. S.  economy gained about 6. 6 million jobs in Trump's first 36 months in office, after roughly 8. 1 million jobs in Obama's last 36 months. In January 2017, Trump took office after 75 straight months of jobs growth. Trump has touted the millions of jobs created since the economy began reopening -- including 2. 5 million in May, 4. 8 million in June, and 1. 8 million in July -- but the economy, in the midst of the worst crisis since the Great Depression, still has roughly 13 million fewer jobs than it did in February. After years of steady quarterly GDP growth since the Great Recession, the government reported a 9. 5% decline in goods and services produced in the second quarter of 2020 -- wiping out nearly five years of growth. Federal relief efforts have also blunted the impact of the coronavirus on the economy -- though negotiations between Democrats and the White House to extend expired small business and unemployment benefits have stalled for weeks. More than one million Americans filed for unemployment this week, according to the Labor Department.  The weekly claims figure has been north of one million nearly every week since March -- raising questions about a \\\"V-shaped\\\" recovery predicted by the White House. -- ABC News' Benjamin Siegel 9:14 p. m.  Trump to deliver 'tough' speech blasting Biden's record, campaign aides say Trump is set to deliver a blistering speech to accept his nomination, targeting Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden on a slew of topics including borders, taxes, energy policy, trade, China and crime, according to Trump campaign aides. The president is expected to blast Biden with familiar lines of attacks including hammering his decades long career in Washington and reiterating his claim that Democrats' agenda is \\\"the most extreme set of proposals ever put forward by a major party nominee,\\\" according to excerpts from Trump's RNC acceptance speech. Trump will lay out \\\"two distinct visions: the president's vision against Joe Biden's vision,\\\" Trump campaign communications director Tim Murtaugh said, while detailing the \\\"unvarnished Joe Biden record and the unvarnished Joe Biden agenda\\\" and not the \\\"cleansed scrubbed version that we saw during the Democratic National Convention. \\\"The president will also place a strong emphasis on \\\"jobs and economic recovery and economic excellence\\\" while claiming Biden's record is one that had \\\"raised taxes will raise taxes again. \\\"Biden told ABC \\\"World News Tonight\\\" anchor David Muir in an interview which aired Sunday that his administration would impose \\\"no new taxes\\\" to households making under $400,000 a year. Trump will also mention Hurricane Laura and \\\"ask for God's blessing\\\" for those in its path and mention the unrest in American cities, the campaign said.  -- ABC News' Will Steakin and Terrance Smith 9:09 p. m.  McConnell: Considers it his 'responsibility to look out for Middle America'Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said he considers it his \\\"responsibility to look out for Middle America. \\\"\\\"I'm immensely proud of the work the Republican Senate has done.  We are the firewall against Nancy Pelosi's agenda. \\\"9:05 p. m.  Rep.  Jeff Van Drew: 'The party had moved from liberal to radical'Rep.  Jeff Van Drew, who left the Democratic Party to become a Republican slammed House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and members of the so-called \\\"Squad. \\\"\\\"I was already uncomfortable with a San Francisco liberal running the House,\\\" he said adding that now \\\"the party had moved from liberal to radical. \\\"\\\"Joe Biden is being told what to do by the radicals running my former party, the same radicals trying to install him as their puppet president,\\\" he continued. 8:58 p. m.  RNC alludes to protests against police violence, without mentioning victims by nameAccording to the ABC News' Political Unit's count Jacob Blake's name has been mentioned one time during the Republican National Convention -- during the opening prayer on Tuesday night. Blake is a 29-year-old black man who police in Kenosha, Wisconsin, shot seven times in the back on Sunday, leading to several days of protests calling to end police violence against people of color. On the second night of the convention Norma Urrabazo, pastor of the International Church of Las Vegas, called for healing to Blake and his family and community. \\\"Lord, we come before you to ask for your spirit of peace to come over hurting communities in Wisconsin tonight.  We pray for healing and comfort to Jacob Blake and his family.  We pray for your protection over those who put their lives in harm's way to bring safety and security to our streets,\\\" Urrabazo said in the opening prayer. Vice President Mike Pence alluded to protests around Blake's shooting and George Floyd's death without mentioning them by name in his acceptance speech on Wednesday night, saying \\\"We will have law and order on the streets of this country for every American of every race and creed and color. \\\"\\\"The American people know we don't have to choose between supporting law enforcement and standing with our African-American neighbors to improve the quality of their lives, education, jobs, and safety,\\\" Pence said. \\\"And from the first days of this administration, we've done both.  And we will keep supporting law enforcement and keep supporting our African-American and minority communities across this land for four more years. \\\"RNC Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel told ABC News' Powerhouse Politics podcast that speakers can and should mention Blake, noting that the president has reached out to the family and that a lot of the remarks were pretaped. -- ABC News' Alisa Wiersema 8:49 p. m.  McCarthy on how Trump worked with CongressHouse Minority Leader Rep.  Kevin McCarthy highlighted the ways in which he said the president has worked with Congress during his term in office. \\\"Four years ago President Trump promised to be your voice.  He kept that promise, but there's still so much more to do.  The choice before you cannot be clearer: forward in freedom or backward in socialism. \\\"8:45 p. m.  Protesters gather near White House ahead of Trump's acceptance speechProtesters have been gathering at Black Lives Matter plaza near the White House ahead of the president's acceptance speech later tonight. \\\"The president has a history of being silent when it comes to the shooting and the killing of Black Americans,\\\" ABC News White House correspondent Rachel Scott said on ABC News Live, \\\"and it's that silence and the lack of action that promotes the outrage that you are seeing. \\\"8:34 p. m.  Jonathan Karl on the convention event at the White HouseOn ABC News Live, Chief White House Correspondent Jonathan Karl said the set up for a convention event left him, \\\"practically speechless, here.  I have been covering the White House on and off for two decades.  … Here we have the entire South Lawn of the White House transformed into the hall, the venue, for a national political convention. \\\"8:23 p. m.  DNC to air ad slamming Trump's leadership during Republican National ConventionThe Democratic National Committee plans to counter Trump's acceptance speech with an ad casting Trump as a failed leader by using his own words during the 2016 convention.  It will be overlaid with footage from events during his first term in office, including video from the white supremacist rally that took place in Charlottesville, Virginia, in August 2017. \\\"Donald Trump's chaotic leadership and divisive rhetoric has been a disaster for Americans.  His failures have led to over 180,000 deaths, left millions unemployed and decimated our economy,\\\" said DNC War Room senior spokesperson Lily Adams.  \\\"During his 2016 convention, Trump himself spoke against the same sort of chaos he has caused in our country.  It's clear to Americans that we can't afford four more years of Trump. \\\"The minute-long ad will air on television in Washington and is part of a six-figure ad buy over the week. It starts with the president at the 2016 convention saying, \\\"The most basic duty of government is to defend the lives of its own citizens, any government that fails to do so is unworthy to lead. \\\"Democrats have tried to counter-program the Republicans' convention in some way every night. -- ABC News' Quinn Scanlan8:18 p. m.  COVID-19 protocol for the Trump's White House remarks: Document ABC News obtained a document from a RNC source that was sent to some guests invited to the evening's celebration at the White House.  It included details on the coronavirus protocols in place -- or lack thereof. The document made no mention of COVID-19 tests.  Instead, it asks guests to stay home if they aren't feeling well, experiencing symptoms, have recently tested positive for the virus or have recently been in close contact with someone who has. It says masks are only required at arrival and in security screening areas and encouraged in \\\"high-traffic areas including restrooms and hospitality spaces. \\\" It also says to \\\"practice social distancing whenever possible. \\\"Upwards of 1,500 people are expected to attend Trump's speech, sources tell ABC News, and photos show chairs placed on the South Lawn without six-feet of distance recommended by the CDC. Separately, the Trump campaign sent a statement to the print pool reporter in response to a request for details about COVID-19 protocols, screening, testing and masks. The statement -- from an executive at the company the RNC is working with, Patronus Medical -- says that \\\"strict protocols are in full compliance with multiple guidelines set forth by the United States Centers for Disease Control, the District of Columbia Department of Public Health, and other leading authorities on health safety. \\\"No other details were provided.  -- ABC News' Rachel Scott and Ben Gittleson  8:12 p. m.  Harris slams Trump on coronavirus, calls Blake shooting 'sickening,' in counter programming event In her first solo event as the Democratic vice presidential nominee, Sen.  Kamala Harris delivered a preemptive strike on Republicans Thursday in wide-ranging remarks ahead of the convention -- slamming Trump's response to Americans suffering amid systematic racism and the coronavirus pandemic. \\\"The Republican convention is designed for one purpose: to soothe Donald Trump's ego.  To make him feel good.  Well here's the thing -- he's the president of the United States.  And it's not supposed to be about him.  It's supposed to be about the health and the safety and the wellbeing of the American people,\\\" Harris said from George Washington University's campus. Harris directly addressed the shooting of Jacob Black, something the president has not yet done publicly. \\\"As Vice President Biden put it, the shots fired at Mr.  Blake pierced the soul of our nation.  It's sickening to watch.  It's all too familiar.  And it must end,\\\" she said. On the pandemic front, Harris said Trump got it \\\"wrong from the beginning\\\" and \\\"was fixated on the stock market over fixing the problem. \\\"\\\"Here's what you have to understand about the nature of a pandemic.  It's relentless.  You can't stop it with a tweet,\\\" she said. It was the biggest counter programming event for Democrats this week. -- ABC News' Averi Harper 8:04 p. m.  McConnell targets 'middle America,' calls Republican Senate a 'firewall' against Democrats Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell used his home state of Kentucky to appeal to \\\"middle America,\\\" calling himself the only leader in Washington not from New York or California. Trump is from New York and all 50 states, Puerto Rico and the U. S.  Virgin Islands, are represented in Congress. \\\"Today's Democrat party doesn't want to improve life for middle America.  They prefer that all of us in flyover country keep quiet and let them decide how we should live our lives,\\\" McConnell said, going on to list Democratic priorities he said would tell Americans what to do, including when to resume activities like work and school during the coronavirus pandemic. McConnell specifically called out Democratic support for making the District of Columbia a state, saying, \\\"With two more liberal senators, we cannot undo the damage they've done. \\\"\\\"I am immensely proud of the work the Republican Senate has done.  We are the firewall against Nancy Pelosi's agenda,\\\" he said. -- ABC News' Kendall Karson 7:45 p. m.  Trump to address Kenosha 'unrest' in RNC acceptance speech, unclear if he'll mention Jacob Blake by name After days of public silence on the shooting of Jacob Blake in Kenosha, Wisconsin, it remains unclear whether Trump will directly address the shooting in his nomination acceptance speech. During an interview Thursday morning, Trump campaign communications director Tim Murtaugh strongly suggested the president would directly address the latest incident involving police treatment of an unarmed black man -- before later appearing to walk back his comments. \\\"I think he will,\\\" Tim Murtaugh said, when asked on CNN if the president would speak directly about the Blake shooting in his address.  \\\"He'll talk about what happened in Wisconsin and I think he'll broaden it and talk with what we've seen in cities and states all around the country in the last couple of months. \\\"Later, when asked whether Trump would specifically mention Blake, Murtaugh declined to elaborate. \\\"I'm not going to get into very much in the way of specifics about what the president will talk about as far as specific topics, but the president will address the unrest in this country.  He will make reference to Kenosha, and he will speak about the issue,\\\" he told ABC News.  -- ABC News' Jordyn Phelps and Will Steakin  7:34 p. m.  DHS employees receive Hatch Act warning after acting secretary's RNC appearance, ahead of White House speech An internal message sent out to all Department of Homeland Security employees Thursday, which was reviewed by ABC News, reminded them to not engage in \\\"partisan political activity\\\" after acting Secretary Chad Wolf participated in a naturalization ceremony earlier this week that was made part of the RNC's prime time programming -- a potential violation of the Hatch Act. \\\"We, as a department, are under heightened scrutiny during the presidential election cycle,\\\" the email said.  \\\"It is important that we, DHS employees, are familiar with the policies surrounding partisan political activity to make sure we comply with them. \\\"The message comes as House Democrats have launched an investigation into Secretary of Mike Pompeo's participation in the RNC while overseas on an official state trip.  -- ABC News' Luke Barr 7:24 p. m.  ABC News' 2020 interactive election mapWho will win in November?  See how the Electoral College could play out with ABC News' 2020 interactive election map: 7:17 p. m.  RNC chair said she hopes Blake's name will be mentioned in final night's program RNC Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel told ABC News' \\\"Powerhouse Politics\\\" podcast Thursday that she hoped Blake's name comes up in convention speeches Thursday night, but she didn't single out Trump's speech. \\\"Of course, we can make mention of Jacob Blake's name and the president has reached out to the family,\\\" McDaniel told ABC News Political Director Rick Klein and Chief White House Correspondent Jonathan Karl. She said the virtual nature of the speeches, prompted by the coronavirus pandemic, meant some speeches were taped before Blake was in the news. \\\"I hope that they do tonight.  I think a lot of it has been pre-taped . . .  because of the virtual nature of many of the speeches, that wasn't in the news at the time that some of those speeches were taped.  I'm saying right now as party chair we want to see this investigated; we want to see this seen through,\\\" she said on Blake's shooting.  -- ABC News' Terrance Smith 7 p. m.  Thursday night's extended speaker lineup The Trump campaign released a list of speakers for the final night of the convention. 7 p. m.  Speaker overviewSenior adviser Ivanka Trump will introduce her father on the final night of what's become a norms-busting political convention, which has showcased the pageantry of the presidency in unprecedented ways and transformed the White House into a backdrop for Trump's campaign -- despite some of the proceedings appearing to violate ethics laws. Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy of California, Arkansas Sen.  Tom Cotton and the president's personal attorney and former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani are also expected to speak Thursday. In addition, convention watchers will hear from the parents of humanitarian aid worker Kayla Mueller, who was killed by the Islamic State while a hostage, and Alice Johnson, a woman who was serving a life sentence in federal prison until Trump commuted her sentence -- an effort in part pushed by Kim Kardashian West. Trump and Vice President Mike Pence will face Democratic nominees Joe Biden and Kamala Harris in the general election on Nov.  3, though some Americans are expecting to receive their ballots as early as next week.

US now has more than 105,000 cases of coronavirusThe amount of novel coronavirus cases around the world and in the U. S.  continues to skyrocket.  By Saturday night, the number of diagnosed COVID-19 cases around the world surpassed 664,000. It was just Thursday that the globe reached 500,000 cases, which was double the number of coronavirus cases from the week before. The U. S.  surpassed 124,000 diagnosed coronavirus cases Saturday, according to data compiled by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering at Johns Hopkins University.  There are at least 2,190 deaths in the country. At least 140,000 people have recovered from the virus during this pandemic. Tune into ABC at 1 p. m.  ET and ABC News Live at 4 p. m.  ET every weekday for special coverage of the novel coronavirus with the full ABC News team, including the latest news, context and analysis. Today's biggest developments:Here's how the news developed Saturday.  All times Eastern. After initially being restricted from passing through the Panama Canal, the country has changed its tune and the cruise ship MS Zaandam will be allowed through. There are more than 130 people on the ship suffering from \\\"flu-like symptoms,\\\" as well as two people who have tested positive for COVID-19 and four elderly passengers who have died. The MS Rotterdam, owned by Holland America, like the Zaandam, was also waiting to transit the canal. \\\"We are aware of reported permission for both Zaandam and Rotterdam to transit the Panama Canal in the near future,\\\" Holland American said in a statement at 11 p. m.  Eastern time.  \\\"We greatly appreciate this consideration in the humanitarian interest of our guests and crew.  This remains a dynamic situation, and we continue to work with the Panamanian authorities to finalize details. \\\"An inmate has died from COVID-19 at FCI Oakdale in Oakdale, Louisiana, two sources told ABC News. This is the first known death inside the Bureau of Prisons. Patrick Jones, 49, was sentenced to 324 months in prison for or possession of 425 grams of crack cocaine with intent to sell within 1,000 feet of a junior college, the BOP said in a press release. Jones was the first inmate inside the BOP to test positive on March 19.  He was placed on a ventilator one day later and he died Saturday. Officials said he had preexisting conditions that contributed to his death. Madison Square Garden Company CEO James Dolan has tested positive for coronavirus, according to a spokesperson. Dolan, 64, took over as CEO of Cablevision, the powerhouse cable company, from his father, Charles, but is most known in New York City for being owner of the NBA's New York Knicks and NHL's New York Rangers. As chairman of The Madison Square Garden Company, he oversees those teams as well as television station MSG Network and owns the world famous Madison Square Garden in Manhattan. Cablevision was sold in 2016 upon which time he left as CEO. Sophie Grégoire Trudeau, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's wife, has been given a clean bill of health after previously testing positive for coronavirus. She said in a Facebook post Saturday night that she was cleared by her doctor and Ottawa Public Health. From the bottom of my heart, I want to say thank you to everyone who reached out to me with their well wishes.  And to everyone who is suffering right now, I send you all my love. \\\"These are challenging times,\\\" she wrote.  \\\"I know it’s not easy to be alone -- we are all social beings, me included!  But just because we’re increasing the physical distance between us doesn’t mean we have to do the same emotionally.  From social media to a simple phone call, there are so many ways for us to stay connected while we’re apart and actually deepen our relationships. \\\"Sophie tested positive for the virus March 13.  Her husband said he never developed symptoms and continued working. Maryland Gov.  Larry Hogan announced tonight that a nursing facility in Mt.  Airy, Maryland, was hit by an outbreak of COVID-19. A total of 66 residents have tested positive at the facility, with 11 currently hospitalized. After threatening it earlier in the day, President Donald Trump now says he will not be using an enforceable quarantine in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut. Instead Trump said he has asked the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to issue a strong travel advisory \\\"to be administered by the Governors, in consultation with the Federal Government. \\\"The CDC later issued its advisory, writing in a release, \\\"Due to extensive community transmission of COVID -19 in the area, CDC urges residents of New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut to refrain from non-essential domestic travel for 14 days effective immediately.  This Domestic Travel Advisory does not apply to employees of critical infrastructure industries, including but not limited to trucking, public health professionals, financial services, and food supply. \\\"The statement also said the governors of Connecticut, New York and New Jersey would have full oversight of implementing the advisory. The governors of each of the three states -- all Democrats -- had reacted strongly against the proposed measure. \\\"That is not a quarantine, that is a lockdown,\\\" New York Gov.  Andrew Cuomo said in an interview on CNN, likening the restriction to Wuhan, China.  \\\"I don’t believe it would be legal.  I believe it would be illegal. \\\"The death toll from novel coronavirus passed 2,000 in the United States on Saturday evening. The number has increased dramatically in recent days, with the toll crossing 1,000 just Wednesday. There are now more than 30,000 deaths worldwide -- about one-third in Italy. New York Presbyterian's hospital network will comply with Gov.  Andrew Cuomo's executive order requiring one partner be allowed in delivery rooms during childbirth. Previously, the hospital network had said no partners would be allowed in the delivery room to combat the pandemic. Cuomo's order applies to all hospitals in the state, both public and private. Mount Sinai, which instituted a similar obstetrics ban, also will comply with the order. Melissa DeRosa, secretary to Cuomo, announced the executive order would be issued on Saturday. An infant was among the 13 new deaths reported in Illinois, the state's Department of Public Health reported. \\\"If you haven't been paying attention, this is your wake-up call,\\\" Dr.  Ngozi Ezike, the director of the state's health agency, said.  \\\"We don't want to be one of the hotspots that the Surgeon General predicts Chicago could be. ”No details around the infant's death were provided. Ezike said a full investigation was underway to determine the cause of death. “There has never before been a death associated with COVID-19 in an infant. The Department of Public Health noted that while older adults are at higher risk of severe illness, and more than 85% of deaths in Illinois are among individuals 60 years of age and older, people of all ages are suffering severe illness. There were also an additional 465 new cases in Illinois, where there is a total of 3,491 confirmed cases. The global death toll has reached at least 30,249, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. Italy has the highest number of reported deaths, at more than 10,000, followed by Spain at more than 5,800. President Donald Trump said he had compelled General Motors to manufacture ventilators, after saying the day before that \\\"maybe we won't even need the full activation,\\\" referring to using the Defense Protection Act. \\\"This week, I invoked the Defense Production Act to compel General Motors to carry out federal contracts for ventilators and I think they're going to do a great job.  I have to say that,\\\" Trump said in his speech at Norfolk Naval Base. The president also said that FEMA has \\\"shipped or delivered\\\" 11. 6 million N-95 respirators, 26 million surgical masks and 5. 2 million face shields. The number of confirmed cases in Italy continue to slow, with 5,933 new cases reported Saturday -- a 6. 8% increase in total new cases, down from Friday's 7. 3%. It was the lowest percentage increase to date in the country.  The total number of cases in Italy is now at least 92,472, health officials said. In the province of Bergamo, the hardest-hit province, there was a nearly 50% drop in new reported cases, from Friday's 602 to Saturday's 289. However, the number of new deaths in the last 24 hours hit 889, bringing the total death toll to 10,023. The United Nations will donate 250,000 protective face masks to New York City, an area now considered the epicenter of the pandemic. UN Secretary General António Guterres said the masks would go to medical professionals in the city who have been \\\"working courageously, selflessly, and tirelessly in response to the spread of COVID-19 across the boroughs in the hope that they play some small role in saving lives. \\\"The U. N.  and U. S.  Mission personnel are working with Mayor Bill de Blasio's office to quickly get the masks to medical facilities in New York City. The Vatican press office confirmed Saturday that the Pope has been tested and neither he nor his closest aides have resulted positive. President Donald Trump said he may announce an enforceable quarantine in the New York, New Jersey and Connecticut areas. Trump noted that he \\\"doesn't want to do it, but may have to. \\\"“There's a possibility that sometime today we'll do a quarantine, short-term two weeks, on New York, probably New Jersey, certain parts of Connecticut,” Trump told reporters on the South Lawn. The president said that he would restrict travel from those areas because \\\"they're having problems down in Florida, a lot of New Yorkers going down, we don't want that. \\\" He later said such a quarantine would not apply to truckers from outside of New York who are making deliveries or traveling through the state. \\\"It won't affect trade in anyway,\\\" Trump said. New York Gov.  Andrew Cuomo later responded to the possibility, saying he had not spoken to the president about such a measure and did not know what it would mean. Connecticut Gov.  Ned Lamont also issued a statement, saying, \\\"Our state has already called on residents to stay at home.  Further, if interstate travel is absolutely necessary, our state has directed travelers to self-quarantine to prevent against further transmission of the virus. \\\" Lamont said that he looked forward to speaking to the president directly, \\\"because confusion leads to panic. \\\"There are now 52,318 confirmed cases in New York, after 7,681 new cases were reported in the last 24 hours, Gov.  Andrew Cuomo said in a press conference. The deaths in the state were up to 728 from 519. Cuomo did say there was a bit of good news: new hospitalizations and new ICU admissions went down in the last 24-hour period.  He cautioned that one day does not prove a trend and the situation certainly could go the other way. There were 372 people admitted in to an ICU Friday and 172 admitted Saturday.  For new hospitalizations, the number Friday was 1,154 and 847 for Saturday. “The overall line is still up,” Cuomo said.  “This is good news on a one day number. ”The governor also announced he was postponing the presidential primary in the state from April 28 to June 23, the date of the state's down ballot primary elections. President Donald Trump declared a major disaster in Massachusetts and Michigan, ordering federal assistance to the states. Federal funding will now be available for crisis counseling for those affected in both states. A New York Police Department detective has become the department's first uniformed officer to die after contracting coronavirus, police sources told ABC News. Detective Cedric Dixon was the officer who died.  He was the third member of the department to die after contracting the virus, following a janitor and an administrative aid. “We are hurting, we are crying and we continue to fight,” Police Commissioner Dermot Shea said Saturday afternoon. Dixon was 48.  According to police sources, he had underlying conditions. The SeaWorld theme parks will remain temporarily closed, according to a statement from the company.  The park had originally planned to open at the end of March. Animal care experts will still be onsite to care for the animals.  \\\"During this time, our animal care experts will continue to look after the health and welfare needs of the animals in our care,\\\" a statement from SeaWord read. \\\"We look forward to welcoming our valued guests back to our parks soon,\\\" the statement continued. Nearly 200 cities in the United States do not have an adequate supply of tests kits or face masks for medical personnel and first responders, including police, fire, and EMTs, according to a report from the U. S.  Conference of Mayors. About 88% of cities of the cities surveyed, or 186 cities, don't have enough personal protective equipment (PPE) other than face masks to protect the front-line workers, according to the report. The staggering statistics \\\"illustrates the scope and severity of the need for COVID-19 emergency equipment in this nation's cities,\\\" according to a letter from the conference's executive director, Tom Cochran. One-hundred and thirty-one states have reported receiving no emergency equipment from their states, while 84% of those who are receiving help say it is not adequate for their needs. The report estimates that across the cities surveyed there is a need for 28. 5 million face masks, 24. 4 million PPE items, 7. 9 million test kits, and 139,000 ventilators. There were 213 cities in 40 states that participated in the survey. \\\"It is abundantly clear that the shortage of essential items such as face masks, test kits, personal protective equipment, ventilators and other items needed by health and safety personnel has reached crisis proportions in cities across the country,\\\" Cochran said in his letter. Spain reported 8,189 new cases of novel coronavirus in the last 24 hours, putting the total number of cases at 72,248, according to the Health Ministry. There have now been 5,690 deaths after 832 new deaths occurred.  More than 4,500 still remain in intensive care. The German Aerospace Center will make medical equipment using its 3D printers, according to a statement from the agency. The printers were tested and can successfully produce protective masks and valves for respirators, the statement read. The German Aerospace Center had been asked by the European Commission to help in producing much needed medical equipment as the world scrambles to combat the pandemic. The most powerful printer can produce up to 10 protective masks or 15 valves for ventilators per day, according to the agency.  However, it's possible to increase the quantity through networking with other institutes and facilities. Air pollution has dropped significantly across Europe as lockdowns have been adopted and residents are told to stay home, according to the European Space Agency. Satellite images from the Copernicus Sentinel-5P show the drop in nitrogen dioxide concentrations, which coincides with the quarantine measures, according to the agency. The most significant drops were in Milan, Paris and Madrid. Scientists from the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute (KNMI) have been using data from the satellite to monitor both weather and pollution over Europe.  The images show the nitrogen dioxide concentrations from March 14 to March 25, comparing it to the averages from last year. \\\"By combining data for a specific period of time, 10 days in this case, the meteorological variability partly averages out and we begin to see the impact of changes due to human activity,\\\" Henk Eskes, from KNMI, said in a statement. Other countries are also being monitored, including the Netherlands and the United Kingdom.  Scientists have said that right now there is a larger variability because of changing weather conditions, making it more difficult to observe any changes. A day after announcing all vehicles with New York license plates will be pulled over by state police and travelers informed they must quarantine if they are staying in the state, Rhode Island Gov.  Gina Raimondo announced that the National Guard would go door-to-door to make sure New Yorkers are following orders. \\\"We have a pinpointed a risk that we need to address, and that risk is New York City,\\\" Raimondo said Friday during her daily coronavirus media briefing.  She said the 14-day quarantine for New York travelers is a law and will be enforced, \\\"it's not a suggestion. \\\"Members of the National Guard will be stationed at bus and train stops, as well as airports to collect personal information form travelers when they arrive.  State police officers are doing the same for vehicles they pull over.  With that information, Raimondo said authorities would go hotels, vacation homes and any type of residence to keep track of New York travelers. All these measures, she said, are designed to let the state have time to get ready for the spread of COVID-19.  If Rhode Island were to have an outbreak right now, she said the state and its healthcare system would be overwhelmed. \\\"We are not ready for a surge of cases,\\\" Raimondo said. New York City currently has at least 26,000 diagnosed cases of COVID-19, with 450 deaths.  There are more than 44,000 cases in New York state.  As of Friday, only 28 of the 203 diagnosed coronavirus cases in Rhode Island have required hospitalization.  The state has no reported COVID-19 deaths.

View more opinion at CNN.  \\n    \\n  President Trump’s former personal lawyer Michael Cohen made a series of shocking allegations about the commander in chief Wednesday. \\n\\n  As the President spent his day overseas trying to reach a historic deal with the North Koreans, Cohen painted a portrait of a leader who has engaged in all sorts of fraud, broke campaign finance laws, associated with devious figures, knew of the dirty and possibly illegal tricks being done by some members of his campaign and who instructed associates like Cohen to intimidate people who were perceived as a threat. \\n\\n  As if that was not enough, Cohen alleged that the President is a racist.  (All of these allegations have been denied by the White House or by the President’s GOP defenders. ) \\n\\n  But will the hearings change public opinion?  \\n\\n  The Republicans on the Oversight Committee gave a pretty good indication of why President Trump’s base is unlikely to move even a little.  They essentially are in tune with Trump’s statement from 2016: “I could stand in the middle of 5th Avenue and shoot somebody and I wouldn’t lose voters. ”\\n\\n  Throughout their questioning of Cohen, the Republicans showed absolutely no interest in probing the issues that were raised about the President.  \\n\\nI was one of the 500 people Michael Cohen threatened\\n\\n  They spent the entire time  attacking Cohen’s behavior and making insinuations about the Democratic-led hearings themselves.  Republicans took every opportunity to remind the public that Cohen is on his way to prison, in part for lying to Congress.  They used Cohen’s lawyer and former Clinton associate, Lanny Davis, and suggestions about mysterious forces funding him, as the bogeyman to allege that Cohen’s testimony was politically motivated.  \\n\\n  The actual substance of the charges, which have not only been raised by Cohen but have come from multiple investigations, were of no interest.  Republicans didn’t want to listen to his answers and used this opportunity to grandstand for their voters.  Their performance reveals how many of Trump’s most loyal Republicans will certainly act.  \\n\\n  But that does not mean that portions of the Republican Party outside the base can’t be moved by congressional hearings.  After all, what motivates their ongoing support for President Trump is much more about partisan interests than loyalty.  This means he is not invulnerable.  It would be possible to turn segments of the party against him if he has taken actions that they feel are too risky.  \\n\\nMichael Cohen is making history\\n\\n  The first tangible evidence that defections are possible since the passage of the Russians sanctions legislation in 2017, were the 13 Republicans who voted with House Democrats to pass a resolution seeking to revoke his emergency power to build a wall.  \\n\\n  It was also clear to President Trump during the final days of the shutdown that his time for that battle was over: either he agreed to pass a budget resolution or the Republicans would move forward without him.  With the midterms only a few months behind them and polls showing that Trump is struggling in the battleground states which were key to his victory, such as Wisconsin and Michigan, Republicans are justifiably worried.  \\n\\n  These signs of defection are certainly far from any indication that he is at any risk with his own party. \\n\\nWhy did Trump need to employ a professional liar? \\n\\n  But it would be a mistake to discount the potential for full-blown hearings to change the dynamics within the Republican Party and to further damage Trump’s standing with independent voters.  The testimony of Michael Cohen alone won’t do the trick.  He is a severely flawed witness given his record, and his words alone cannot paint a damning picture of the administration to Republicans who remain focused on victory in 2020.  \\n\\n  Committee Republicans demonstrated that they have no interest in listening.  The conservative media, which didn’t exist when Richard Nixon was president, will be spinning the day’s events a million different ways, in Trump’s favor.  \\n\\n  However, robust hearings can matter.  Seeing and hearing the major players in a scandal is much different than reading about them or seeing a prosecutorial report.  \\n\\n  The gold standard remains the Watergate committee that did have the effect, over a period of many weeks and with numerous witnesses, to break down the Republican support that President Nixon continued to count on until the very end.  The congressional hearings and investigations were successful in that they helped legislators in both parties gain a fuller picture of what the Nixon White House was about and to put the original sin, the break-in of the Democratic National Committee headquarters, into a larger context.  \\n\\n  Some of the outcome in 2019 will depend on the Democrats and how far they are willing to go to ensure accountability and pursue a full-blown investigation, even at the risk of political backlash.  \\n© 2021 Cable News Network.

The ministry of corporate affairs (MCA) has already notified the two amendments in the CSR rules on Monday that would allow companies to spend their CSR funds in R&D activities related to new vaccine, drugs and medical devices in three financial years starting from 2020-21. The Companies Act requires firms with a net worth of Rs 500 crore or more, or turnover of Rs 1,000 crore or more, or net profit of Rs 5 crore or more in the immediately preceding financial year, to mandatorily spend 2% of average net profit of the preceding three years on CSR.  Money earmarked for spending on CSR activities in a year is about Rs 15,000 crore. MCA has amended the Schedule VII to include R&D for development of drugs to cure Covid-19 as one of the approved CSR activities, a second official said.  The government has specified broad areas of mandatory CSR spending in Schedule VII. Accordingly, contributions to R&D projects in the field of science, technology, engineering and medicine, funded by the central or state governments or any public sector entity would also be counted under CSR, he added.  Companies can now contribute their CSR funds to public funded universities, Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs), Department of Atomic Energy (DAE), Department of Biotechnology (DBT), Department of Science and Technology (DST) and Department of Pharmaceuticals, he said.  They can also participate in institutions under the ministry of ayurveda, yoga and naturopathy, unani, siddha and homoeopathy (AYUSH), he said.  Approved activities under Schedule VII of CSR include eradicating extreme hunger, poverty, promotion of education, promoting gender equality and women’s empowerment as well as reducing the child mortality, improving maternal health and combating diseases.  Ensuring environmental sustainability and prompting employment enhancing vocational skills are other activities approved under CSR. \",\n  \"document_ocr\": \"saryte\\nMe\\na Ba Kena\\nMea ANa\\na 0,5\\nTatycea:\\n06.208\\n04.2011\\nneparype\\n.\\nteunapal\\nonpene\\n\",\n  \"Category\": \"Insufficient_Text\"\n}, {\n  \"Id\": 34981,\n  \"claim_image\": \"http://pbs.twimg.com/media/DxkGVtyWkAAM6rn.jpg?format=jpg&name=large\",\n  \"claim\": \"The White House has reached out to Covington Catholic High School students after video of an encounter between students &amp; an Omaha Nation elder stirred debate.\\n\\n\\\"We've reached out and voiced our support\\\" for the students, press secretary Sarah Sanders said https://t.co/AmZ99NI4pb https://t.co/givq6wNzSf\",\n  \"claim_ocr\": \"RATA\\nMAKEA\\nGREAT A\\nIDEC\\n20\\n\",\n  \"document_image\": \"http://pbs.twimg.com/media/DxndqI2WkAAlNCm.jpg?format=jpg&name=large\",\n  \"document\": \"A Florida detective told investigators that the former deputy entrusted to protect a high school where 17 people died in a mass shooting gave an initial statement filled with inaccuracies about his actionsFORT LAUDERDALE, Fla.  -- A Florida detective told investigators the former deputy entrusted to protect a high school where 17 people died in a mass shooting last year gave an initial statement filled with inaccuracies about his actions. Broward Sheriff's Office Detective John Curcio told investigators that ex-deputy Scot Peterson's story about what happened at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland contains many inconsistencies when compared with video evidence. \\\"There is almost, on every detail that he gave in the statement, inaccuracies,\\\" Curcio said. Curcio is the lead investigator in the criminal case against Nikolas Cruz, 20, who faces the death penalty if convicted in the shooting.  The detective's statement released Tuesday by prosecutors was given to Florida Department of Law Enforcement agents working with a state commission looking into the law enforcement response to the February 2018 mass shooting. The commission, which released a sweeping report critical of the response and recommended improvements, has found Peterson was derelict in his duty for not confronting the gunman and instead staying outside while shots rang out.  The FDLE also has begun a criminal investigation into the response.  Peterson's lawyer declined comment and Peterson himself resigned from the agency months ago. Curcio said Peterson told him two days after the massacre — before Curcio had viewed video of Peterson's actions — that he didn't know where the shots were coming from, thought there may have been a sniper on top of the building and that he only heard up to three shots. \\\"The two to three shots he claims he heard were actually over 70 shots going off inside the building,\\\" Curcio said. Curcio added that Peterson surely knew what his duty was in an active shooter situation. \\\"Every moment you distract the shooter, he's not shooting kids,\\\" Curcio said.  \\\"He's a school resource officer.  He certainly knew what he was supposed to do. \\\"In another development, a judge has denied an effort by defense attorneys to hold the Broward Sheriff's Office in contempt of court for releasing Cruz's medical records to the commission. The order dated Tuesday by Circuit Judge Elizabeth Scherer says the records release was limited, not done in bad faith and was an isolated incident.  Scherer also says the sheriff's office may not have been aware of restrictions she had placed on the records. Defense lawyers wanted Judge Scherer to hold a hearing on whether the sheriff's office should be found in contempt of court for a violating her previous order limiting release of the records. Meanwhile, a California man is accused of using Instagram to \\\"harass and intimidate\\\" the families of students killed in the shooting. A criminal complaint filed in federal court says Brandon Fleury of Santa Ana, California, began the taunts Dec.  22 using different accounts which were traced to an IP address in Santa Ana, where Fleury lives with his father and brother.  He was arrested Friday. Special Agent Cameron McDowell wrote in a 12-page report filed Friday that Fleury showed no remorse when questioned Jan.  16 and that he admitted to a fascination with the mass shooting. Fleury's father, Patrick Fleury, told the SunSentinel it was a \\\"bunch of nonsense\\\" and declined to say whether his son has a lawyer. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events\",\n  \"document_ocr\": \"MARJORY STOMAN DOUGLAS\\nNO MORE\\nUNS\\nGtre\\nHand\\nT Heroes\\nvill make\\nerence.\\nHIGH SCHOOL\\nSOStrong\\ntands by our\\ntvers and Faculty\\nmunity stands by\\nAlh.\\nRhona Wiserhona Wise/AFP/Getty\\n\",\n  \"Category\": \"Insufficient_Text\"\n}, {\n  \"Id\": 34982,\n  \"claim_image\": \"http://pbs.twimg.com/media/DxnGoyXX4AARbwz.jpg?format=jpg&name=large\",\n  \"claim\": \"The White House has not responded in writing to Speaker Nancy Pelosi's letter suggesting postponement of the State of the Union speech, her office says https://t.co/Q6aav5VTuM https://t.co/pE6nRqFOva\",\n  \"claim_ocr\": \"STA\\nBRENDAN SMIALOWSKIZAFP/GETTY IMAGES\\n\",\n  \"document_image\": \"http://pbs.twimg.com/media/DxoN3qPX4AAGI9s.jpg?format=jpg&name=large\",\n  \"document\": \"Trump earlier rejected Pelosi's appeal to delay date until after shutdown. Trump agrees to postpone State of the Union amid shutdownThe back and forth between House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and President Donald Trump over when and where the State of the Union will be delivered -- if at all -- came to a conclusion, if temporary, late Wednesday night.  Trump will not give a speech until after the partial government shutdown is over. The president tweeted the news in a two-part missive just before midnight, saying, \\\"As the Shutdown was going on, Nancy Pelosi asked me to give the State of the Union Address.  I agreed.  She then changed her mind because of the Shutdown, suggesting a later date.  This is her prerogative - I will do the Address when the Shutdown is over. \\\"He ended speculation he might look to give the speech in a location other than the House of Representatives as well, saying he's not looking for another venue. In response, Pelosi took the opportunity to encourage the president to support a bill to fund the government while discussions over border security continue. \\\"Mr.  President, I hope by saying 'near future' you mean you will support the House-passed package to #EndTheShutdown that the Senate will vote on tomorrow,\\\" she said.  \\\"Please accept this proposal so we can re-open government, repay our federal workers and then negotiate our differences. \\\"The bill is mostly likely dead on arrival in the Republican-controlled Senate. In the latest twist in their political and seemingly personal feud earlier Wednesday, Pelosi sent a letter to Trump saying there would be no State of the Union address in the House chamber until after the partial government shutdown ends, effectively rescinding her invitation to the president. \\\"When I extended an invitation on January 3rd for you to deliver the State of the Union address, it was on the mutually agreed upon date, January 29th.   At that time, there was no thought that the government would still be shut down,\\\" her letter said. \\\"I am writing to inform you that the House of Representatives will not consider a concurrent resolution authorizing the President’s State of the Union address in the House Chamber until government has opened,\\\" Pelosi, D-Calif. , said. The resolution is necessary to authorize the president to address a joint session of Congress. \\\"Again, I look forward to welcoming you to the House on a mutually agreeable date for this address when government has been opened,\\\" Pelosi's letter continued. At the White House, Trump told reporters he was \\\"not surprised\\\" by Pelosi's letter. \\\"I’m not surprised.  It’s really a shame what’s happening with the Democrats, they’ve become radicalized,\\\" Trump said when asked for reaction to Pelosi's letter during a photo-op in the Roosevelt Room. Later, at another photo op, Trump said, “The State of the Union has been canceled by Nancy Pelosi because she doesn’t want to hear the truth, she doesn't want the American people to hear what's going on. ”“Now Nancy Pelosi, or Nancy as I call her, she doesn’t want to hear the truth and she doesn't want to hear the American people to hear the truth,\\\" Trump said. \\\"I think that’s a great blotch on the great country we all love, it's a great, great horrible mark.  I don't believe it's ever happened before,\\\" Trump said.  \\\"It's always good to be part of history but this is a negative part of history.  This is where people are afraid to open up and say what's going on. \\\"\\\"If we can handle Iraq, we can handle the middle of Washington and the very spectacular building and a beautiful room that we should be in and that's where it's been for a long time,\\\" Trump said. Upon returning to the Capitol after an afternoon speech, Pelosi made clear that Trump is not welcome to address a joint session of Congress until the shutdown is over. \\\"I still make the offer: let's work together on a mutually agreeable date, as the original date was, mutually agreeable, so we can welcome him properly to the Capitol,\\\" she said. House Minority Whip Steve Scalise told reporters that Pelosi’s decision to rescind the invitation is “a big mistake” and “a disgraceful move. ”“The fact that Nancy Pelosi’s not only holding the paychecks of federal workers hostage, now she’s going to try to hold the State of the Union hostage, shows that she is beholden right now to the most radical left elements of her base,” Scalise, R-La. , said.  “She’s not trying to solve this problem. ”Just a couple of hours earlier, Trump on Wednesday rejected Pelosi's earlier suggestion he delay his State of the Union speech until after the partial government shutdown ends, writing Pelosi to formally affirm he was sticking to plans to deliver the address on Jan.  29 in the House chamber. \\\"I will be honoring your invitation, and fulfilling my Constitutional duty, to deliver important information to the people and Congress of the United States of America regarding the State of our Union,\\\" Trump wrote in a letter to Pelosi on Wednesday afternoon. Trump closed the letter by hinting that the onus would be on Pelosi to cancel the invitation.  \\\"I look forward to seeing you on the evening on January 29th in the Chamber of the House of Representative.  It would be so very sad for our Country if the State of the Union were not delivered on time, on schedule, and very importantly, on location! \\\"Recognizing that Pelosi’s invitation was never officially taken off the table, Trump had seemingly called her bluff, resisting pressure to pull out and deliver the address from another venue elsewhere in Washington, such as at the White House or Senate chamber, or even, as one Republican member of Congress suggested, at the southern border. Pelosi wrote Trump on Jan.  16, appealing to the president to work with her to find “another suitable date” after the partial government shutdown ends, or provide his address in writing -- justifying her suggestion with a warning that “critical” operations at the Department of Homeland Security are “hamstrung by furloughs. ”In his letter, Trump said DHS and the U. S.  Secret Service told him \\\"there would be absolutely no problem regarding security with respect to the event. \\\"Despite the uncertainty prior to the letter, preparations were already moving forward to welcome Trump next Tuesday, as Pelosi has not explicitly disinvited him from an invitation to deliver the annual address from the House chamber. “She didn’t disinvite him.  She suggested another date which would be consistent with a government that was open and was paying the people that we expect to protect us,” House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, the No.  2-ranked Democrat, told reporters during a pen and pad briefing Wednesday.  “It is a very high-security event. ”As a matter of congressional protocol, both the House and Senate must pass a concurrent resolution authorizing the president to deliver an address from the House chamber, though neither chamber has acted yet and no votes on such measures are planned this week. Hoyer, who is empowered with control over which measures are considered on the House floor, said a resolution could be considered as late as next Tuesday -- the same day Pelosi has invited Trump to deliver the address -- without impacting security or logistical planning. “I’m told that that could be passed Tuesday the 29th and be equally effective as if we passed it today,” Hoyer said.  “I think the Capitol Police and Sergeant at Arms have assured us we’ll be fully prepared if in fact there’s a State of the Union address on the 29th. ”Rep.  Mike McCaul, the top Republican on the House Foreign Affairs committee, signaled he hopes the president's efforts will generate a solution to the impasse. “This is a time we need the president to come to the Hill and talk to the Congress,\\\" McCaul, R-Texas, said.  \\\"And so I would hope that Speaker Pelosi would just do the right thing – rise above the partisanship and let the president come talk to the Congress. ”While the shutdown continued in its 33rd day, Hoyer says House Democrats are crafting a letter outlining “substantial” spending on border security to “articulate what we believe is effective. ” He urged the president to end the shutdown, enabling lawmakers to negotiate a border security package and even comprehensive immigration reform without the president using 800,000 federal employees as leverage. “I think her suggestion was a reasonable one,” Hoyer said of Pelosi's suggestion to delay the speech until after government reopens.  “The response we got was that the Secret Service will do its job and other security officers will do their job.  There’s no doubt that they will.  They’re very dedicated, patriotic people, very contentious people.  Paying them or not, they’re going to be doing their job.  We understand that but the fact is the president needs to open up the government. ”ABC News' Meridith McGraw, Jordyn Phelps and Sarah Kolinovsky contributed to this report. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events\",\n  \"document_ocr\": \"PELOSI TO TRUMP: FIND ANOTHER VENUE FOR THE STATE OF THE UNION\\nWASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham (R-South Carolina) today made this statement on a letter from Speaker Nancy\\nPelosi that states she will not introduce a concurrent resolution to invite President Trump to deliver the State of the Union address in\\nthe U.S. House of Representatives.

With a surge in cases of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), an increase in fatality rate, widespread accounts of the struggle to get tested or/and get hospital admissions, and a projection of 532,000 cases by the end of July and the need for 150,000 beds by then, the pandemic has truly come home to the national capital.  It was clear that the Delhi government, led by Arvind Kejriwal, needed help.  The fact that Delhi is the Capital, there is a unique division of powers that exists between the Centre and the state, and Delhi’s health facilities are used by citizens across the country made it even more essential for the central government to step in.  On Sunday, following a meeting of the state disaster management authority, home minister Amit Shah announced a set of much-needed, welcome measures.  The testing rate in the Capital will double in the next two days and triple in six days; the Centre will provide 500 railway coaches, which will add another 8,000 beds to Delhi’s health infrastructure; there will be rigorous contact tracing in containment zones; a high-level committee, within two days, will submit a report on rates to be charged by private hospitals for testing and treatment; new guidelines will be framed for funerals to reduce the waiting time for cremations and burials; the Centre will depute five senior officials to help Delhi with the health crisis; a joint team will inspect facilities in all Covid-19 hospitals; and the Centre will provide oxygen cylinders, ventilators, and other health supplies to the Delhi government. Each of these measures is necessary.  Ramping up testing is the only way to trace the infected and prevent further transmission.  Contact tracing had almost collapsed in the city — and a renewed effort is much-needed.  Private hospitals must be more responsible in their fee structures in times of the pandemic and a degree of regulation will help.  Delhi needs support from all quarters to enhance hospital facilities and beds.  What is inexplicable is why all of this was not done earlier, and why the period of the lockdown was not used better to anticipate the current situation and prepare for it.  Belated as these interventions are, it is welcome and the focus must now be on implementing it.  It is also important to constantly review Delhi’s battle against Covid-19, and provide additional support if necessary.  For the sake of Delhi’s citizens, the Centre and the Delhi government must continue to work together at this moment.  \",\n  \"document_ocr\": \"ANI\\n\",\n  \"Category\": \"Insufficient_Text\"\n}, {\n  \"Id\": 34987,\n  \"claim_image\": \"https://images.hindustantimes.com/rf/image_size_630x354/HT/p2/2020/06/07/Pictures/assignment-name-in-brief_fd4a59a6-a878-11ea-ad77-c76040589f9e.jpg\",\n  \"claim\": \"With a tally of 2,46,628 infections, India is now the fifth worst-hit country in the world. #Covid19 \\n\\nhttps://t.co/5lLVQs6eMG\",\n  \"claim_ocr\": \"\",\n  \"document_image\": \"http://pbs.twimg.com/media/Eevz0aDUYAEEF7c.png?format=jpg&name=large\",\n  \"document\": \"India on Sunday reported 9,971 new cases of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) and 287 deaths, another highest spike, were recorded in the last 24 hours, the Union health ministry data showed.

The full text of his letter is below:\\n\\n\\n  Dear Chairman Graham, Chairman Nadler, Ranking Member Feinstein, and Ranking Member Collins:  \\n\\n  As a supplement to the notification provided on Friday, March 22, 2019, I am writing today to advise you of the principal conclusions reached by Special Counsel Robert S.  Mueller and to inform you about the status of my initial review of the report he has prepared.   \\n\\nThe Special Counsel’s Report  \\n\\n  On Friday, the Special Counsel submitted to me a “confidential report explaining the prosecution or declination decisions” he has reached, as required by 28 C. F. R.  § 600. 8(c).  This report is entitled “Report on the Investigation into Russian Interference in the 2016 Presidential Election. ” Although my review is ongoing, I believe that it is in the public interest to describe the report and to summarize the principal conclusions reached by the Special Counsel and the results of his investigation.   \\n\\n  The report explains that the Special Counsel and his staff thoroughly investigated allegations that members of the presidential campaign of Donald J.  Trump, and others associated with it, conspired with the Russian government in its efforts to interfere in the 2016 U. S.  presidential election, or sought to obstruct the related federal investigations.  In the report, the Special Counsel noted that, in completing his investigation, he employed 19 lawyers who were assisted by a team of approximately 40 FBI agents, intelligence forensic accountants, and other professional staff.  The Special Counsel issued more than 2,800 subpoenas, executed nearly 500 search warrants, obtained more than 230 orders for communication records, issued almost 50 orders authorizing use of pen registers, made 13 requests to foreign governments for evidence, and interviewed approximately 500 witnesses.  \\n\\n  The Special Counsel obtained a number of indictments and convictions of individuals and entities in connection with his investigation, all of which have been publicly disclosed.  During the course of his investigation, the Special Counsel also referred several matters to other offices for further action.  The report does not recommend any further indictments, nor did the Special Counsel obtain any sealed indictments that have yet to be made public.  Below, I summarize the principal conclusions set out in the Special Counsel’s report. \\n\\nRussian Interference in the 2016 U. S.  Presidential Election.  The Special Counsel’s report is divided into two parts.  The first describes the results of the Special Counsel’s investigation into Russia’s interference in the 2016 U. S.  presidential election.  The report outlines the Russian effort to influence the election and documents crimes committed by persons associated with the Russian government in connection with those efforts.  The report further explains that a primary consideration for the Special Counsel’s investigation was whether any Americans  including individuals associated with the Trump campaign joined the Russian conspiracies to influence the election, which would be a federal crime.  The Special Counsel’s investigation did not find that the Trump campaign or anyone associated with it conspired or coordinated with Russia in its efforts to influence the 2016 U. S.  presidential election.  As the report states: “[T]he investigation did not establish that members of the Trump Campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities. ” 1\\n\\n  The Special Counsel’s investigation determined that there were two main Russian efforts to influence the 2016 election.  The first involved attempts by a Russian organization, the Internet Research Agency (IRA), to conduct disinformation and social media operations in the United States designed to sow social discord, eventually with the aim of interfering with the election.  As noted above, the Special Counsel did not find that any U. S.  person or Trump campaign official or associate conspired or knowingly coordinated with the IRA in its efforts, although the Special Counsel brought criminal charges against a number of Russian nationals and entities in connection with these activities. \\n\\n  The second element involved the Russian government’s efforts to conduct computer hacking operations designed to gather and disseminate information to influence the election.  The Special Counsel found that Russian government actors successfully hacked into computers and obtained emails from persons affiliated with the Clinton campaign and Democratic Party organizations, and publicly disseminated those materials through various intermediaries, including WikiLeaks.  Based on these activities, the Special Counsel brought criminal charges against a number of Russian military officers for conspiring to hack into computers in the United States for purposes of influencing the election.  But as noted above, the Special Counsel did not find that the Trump campaign, or anyone associated with it, conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in these efforts, despite multiple offers from Russian-affiliated individuals to assist the Trump campaign. \\n\\nFootnote: 1 In assessing potential conspiracy charges, the Special Counsel also considered whether members of the Trump campaign “coordinated” with Russia election interference activities.  The Special Counsel defined “coordination” as an “agreement—tacit or express—between the Trump Campaign and the Russian government on election interference. ”\\n\\nObstruction of Justice.  The report’s second part addresses a number of actions by the President most of which have been the subject of public reporting that the Special Counsel investigated as potentially raising obstruction-of-justice concerns.  After making a “thorough factual investigation” into these matters, the Special Counsel considered whether to evaluate the conduct under Department standards governing prosecution and declination decisions but ultimately determined not to make a traditional prosecutorial judgment.  The Special Counsel therefore did not draw a conclusion one way or the other as to whether the examined conduct constituted obstruction.  Instead, for each of the relevant actions investigated, the report sets out evidence on both sides of the question and leaves unresolved what the Special Counsel views as “difficult issues” of law and fact concerning whether the President’s actions and intent could be viewed as obstruction.  The Special Counsel states that “while this report does not conclude that the President committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him. ”\\n\\n  The Special Counsel’s decision to describe the facts of his obstruction investigation without reaching any legal conclusions leaves it to the Attorney General to determine whether the conduct described in the report constitutes a crime.  Over the course of the investigation, the Special Counsel’s office engaged in discussions with certain Department officials regarding many of the legal and factual matters at issue in the Special Counsel’s obstruction investigation.  After reviewing the Special Counsel’s final report on these issues; consulting with Department officials, including the Office of Legal Counsel; and applying the principles of federal prosecution that guide our charging decisions, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and I have concluded that the evidence developed during the Special Counsel’s investigation is not sufficient to establish that the President committed an obstruction-of-justice offense.  Our determination was made without regard to, and is not based on, the constitutional considerations that surround the indictment and criminal prosecution of a sitting president.  2\\n\\n  In making this determination, we noted that the Special Counsel recognized that “the evidence does not establish that the President was involved in an underlying crime related to Russian election interference,” and that, while not determinative, the absence of such evidence bears upon the President’s intent with respect to obstruction.  Generally speaking, to obtain and sustain an obstruction conviction, the government would need to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that a person, acting with corrupt intent, engaged in obstructive conduct with a sufficient nexus to a pending or contemplated proceeding.  In cataloguing the President’s actions, many of which took place in public view, the report identifies no actions that, in our judgment, constitute obstructive conduct, had a nexus to a pending or contemplated proceeding, and were done with corrupt intent, each of which, under the Department’s principles of federal prosecution guiding charging decisions, would need to be proven beyond a reasonable doubt to establish an obstruction-of-justice offense. \\n\\nFootnote: 2 See A Sitting President’s Amenability to Indictment and Criminal Prosecution, 24 Op.  O. L. C.  222 (2000)\\n\\nStatus of the Department’s Review\\n\\n  The relevant regulations contemplate that the Special Counsel’s report will be a “confidential report” to the Attorney General.  See Office of Special Counsel, 64 Fed.  Reg.  37,038, 37,040-41 (July 9, 1999).  As I have previously stated, however, I am mindful of the public interest in this matter.  For that reason, my goal and intent is to release as much of the Special Counsel’s report as I can consistent with applicable law, regulations, and Departmental policies. \\n\\n  Based on my discussions with the Special Counsel and my initial review, it is apparent that the report contains material that is or could be subject to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure which imposes restrictions on the use and disclosure of information relating to “matter[s] occurring before grand jury. ” Fed.  R.  Crim.  P.  6(e)(2)(B)  Rule 6(e) generally limits disclosure of certain grand jury information in a criminal investigation and prosecution.  Id.  Disclosure of 6(e) material beyond the strict limits set forth in the rule is a crime in certain circumstances.  See, e. g.  18 U. S. C.  401(3).  This restriction protects the integrity of grand jury proceedings and ensures that the unique and invaluable investigative powers of a grand jury are used strictly for their intended criminal justice function. \\n\\n  Given these restrictions, the schedule for processing the report depends in part on how quickly the Department can identify the 6(e) material that by law cannot be made public.  I have requested the assistance of the Special Counsel in identifying all 6(e) information contained in the report as quickly as possible.  Separately, I also must identify any information that could impact other ongoing matters, including those that the Special Counsel has referred to other offices.  As soon as that process is complete, I will be in a position to move forward expeditiously in determining what can be released in light of applicable law, regulations, and Departmental policies. \\n\\n  * * *\\n\\n  As I observed in my initial notification, the Special Counsel regulations provide that “the Attorney General may determine that public release of” notifications to your respective Committees “would be in the public interest. ” 28 C. F. R.  § 600. 9(c).  I have so determined, and I will disclose this letter to the public after delivering it to you. \\n\\n  Sincerely,\\n\\n  William P.

In India, bird flu or avian influenza is spread mainly by migratory birds coming into India during winter months from between September and March.  The disease is zoonotic.

ABC News Live-House managers make 2nd day of arguments at Senate impeachment trial-Lead manager Adam Schiff: Focus on first article alleging 'abuse of power'-President Trump's constitutional lawyer Alan Dershowitz argues a president cannot be impeached for 'abuse of power'-Schumer says a Trump acquittal will have 'zero value' if no witnesses-Graham compliments Schiff on presentation of House case, but asks 'will it stand up? -Nadler: Trump 'puts President Nixon to shame' in abusing power-Trump legal team concerned Saturday arguments will get buried, may request time changeAs the Senate trial of President Donald Trump resumed Thursday afternoon, lead House manager Adam Schiff argued the law and the Constitution, applied to the facts, support the article of impeachment that accuses him of \\\"abuse of power. \\\"On Wednesday, after laying out the timeline of Trump's pressure campaign against Ukraine, including withholding military aid to get Ukraine to announce an investigation of former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter, Schiff argued that the president violated the Constitution. Alan Dershowitz, the former Harvard Law School professor who is playing a role on Trump's defense team, is expected to argue, as he's been doing on TV, that a sitting president cannot be impeached for abuse of power as Democrats charge. Also on Wednesday, the first of three days of opening arguments, Democrats flatly dismissed the notion of offering Joe or Hunter Biden as witnesses in exchange for Trump's former national security adviser John Bolton. \\\"That trade is not on the table,\\\" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer told reporters. As Thursday's session opened, Chief Justice John Roberts announced that Democrats had 16 hours and 42 minutes left to use over two days before the president's legal team takes the Senate floor on Saturday to begin 24 hours of opening arguments over three days. The ABC News team of correspondents and producers is covering every aspect of the story. This is how the day is unfolding.  Please refresh for updates. In his final statements for the day, Rep.  Adam Schiff wrapped up arguments by pointing senators back to the transcript of the Zelenskiy-Trump July 25 phone call, asking senators to view the transcript in the context of the information they'd been listening to all day.  Schiff ended on an impassioned note, telling senators that Trump's actions demonstrate that he cannot be trusted to act in the best interest of the country, and telling them that they must remove Trump if they find he is guilty of the actions he's accused of. Schiff used the end of his time to argue against the narrative that Republicans seem to be getting ready to argue.  He asked senators to consider, if Trump is guilty, does he really need to be removed from office for these actions? \\\"If you find him guilty you must find that he should be removed,\\\" Schiff said, \\\"because right matters.  Because right matters and the truth matters, otherwise we are lost. \\\"Schiff said Trump's decision to \\\"choose Rudy Giuliani\\\" over the guidance of national security advisers, the FBI and the country shows that Trump is self-interested and cannot be trusted to act in the country's best interest leading up to the election, especially with anticipated election security threats from Russia and China. \\\"You may be asking, 'How much damage can he really do in the next several months until the election? ' Schiff said.  \\\"A lot.  A lot of damage. \\\"Schiff ended by pointing to remarks from Lt.  Col.  Alexander Vindman, who said during his House testimony that \\\"right matters. \\\" Schiff repeated it multiple times before closing. \\\"If right doesn't matter, it doesn't matter how good the Constitution is.  It doesn't matter how brilliant the framers were.  It doesn't matter how good or bad our advocacy in this trial is,\\\" he said.  \\\"If right doesn't matter, we're lost.  If the truth doesn't matter, we're lost. \\\"He also threw some of the president's remarks back at him. \\\"At the beginning of the trial you may have seen the president tweeted a common refrain: 'Read the transcript,' so I thought at the end of the evening I would join in the president's request that you re-read the transcript because now that you know a lot more of the facts of this scheme it reveals a lot more about that conversation. \\\"-- ABC News' Allie PecorinWith Republican senators sounding increasingly irritated by the managers' presentation during their breaks -- telling reporters they are repetitive, etc.  -- the managers continued to thank the senators for listening. House Manager Rep.  Zoe Lofgren said, \\\"It's a long day.  You are here without your cellphones or any access to other information.  It's not easy, but you're paying attention, and the country and the managers thank you for that. Rep.  Jason Crow later echoed the same message as the clock neared 9:30 p. m. : \\\"Just bear with us a little while longer.  I promise we are almost there. \\\"Lofgren used her time after a brief recess to detail the hold on military aid to Ukraine, how Trump \\\"knowingly\\\" and \\\"willfully\\\" broke the law by freezing it and how that related to his abuse of power. \\\"The hold had nothing to do with the national interest.  It had to do with the interest of just one person: Donald J Trump.  The demand for Ukraine to announce these investigations was not a policy decision but a personal decision by the president to benefit his own personal interests,\\\" Lofgren said. She also pulled out a pocket Constitution to remind senators of their responsibilities. \\\"Every year we print a new copy of the Constitution and this year in the back we printed a quote.  At the conclusion of the Constitutional Convention, Benjamin Franklin was asked, 'What have you wrought? ' and he answered, 'A republic, if you can keep it. ' That's the challenge that all of us face and that you senators face. \\\"Senate Republican leadership is laying the groundwork in its caucus for a vote against subpoenaing witnesses by warning that a guaranteed White House court fight over executive privilege would stall the trial and paralyze the Senate for months. Former Attorney General Michael Mukasey was called in on Wednesday to lay out the scenarios for GOP senators, sources familiar with the meeting told ABC News. Mukasey explained how \\\"cumbersome\\\" it would be to subpoena any of the four White House officials sought by the House Democratic managers, the sources said. Several Republicans in the meeting have told us that they'd expect an executive privilege fight over a Senate trial subpoena to take \\\"weeks or months\\\" leaving the body no choice but to remain idle. “There’d be nothing else we could do in the interim,” said Sen John Cornyn of Texas.  “It would basically hijack the senate.  In the meantime, the Senate can't do anything else; we can't confirm judges, we can't have hearings, we can't even introduce legislation. ”Sen.  John Barrasso of Wyoming said lawmakers would get an earful from their constituents -- especially independent voters. \\\"Every day we spend doing this, we're not doing -- I'm a doctor.  I want to lower the cost of insulin.  I want to deal with this surprise medical billings issue.  . . .  But because we're stuck with this, and the longer you are going, and the longer you're dealing with witnesses, the harder it is to get to the things that I hear about in Wyoming. \\\"-- ABC News' Devin DwyerRep.  Hakeem Jeffries continued speaking when the Senate returned from its break around 7:15 p. m. Jeffries' presentation got into the minutia of attempts by top officials to get a meeting planned between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy.  He pointed to multiple instances in which the importance of an investigation was emphasized as a necessary concession to getting a meeting scheduled. \\\"President Trump had immense power over Ukraine and President Trump knew it, so when President Trump asked for a favor on the July 25 call he knew that President Zelenskiy would feel incredible pressure to do exactly what President Trump wanted,\\\" Jeffries said. After displaying text messages between administration officials, Jeffries sampled a portion of the phone call between Trump and Zelenskiy in which Zelenskiy again emphasizes his desire for a White House meeting and spoke to his efforts to possibly pursue \\\"the investigation. \\\" Jeffries said the transcript is damning. \\\"Read the transcript, President Trump says.  We have read the transcript and it is damning evidence of a corrupt quid pro quo,\\\" Jeffries said.  \\\"The evidence against Donald Trump is hiding in plain sight. \\\"Jeffries concluded his comments at 7:47 p. m.  -- and Sylvia Garcia took to the podium.  She continued presenting evidence laying out attempts by Rudy Giuliani to get confirmation of an investigation, and by administration officials to get a meeting scheduled. \\\"The evidence is very clear the White House meeting would only be scheduled if Ukraine announced the investigations that everyone, including the Ukrainians, understood to be purely political efforts to benefit the president,\\\" Garcia said.  \\\"The only way to come to a different conclusion is to ignore the evidence. \\\"-- ABC News' Allie PecorinFollowing a series of tweets Thursday afternoon by Sen.  Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn. , which questioned Lt.  Col.  Alexander Vindman's motivation to testify and his patriotism, his attorney slammed the comments. \\\"This difficult moment in our country calls for seriousness and seriousness of purpose,\\\" David Pressman, who serves as counsel to the Army officer who defied White House orders and appeared before the House impeachment probe, said in a statement. \\\"Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Vindman has sacrificed enormously for our country.  He believes in our country.  And he believes in our country’s great institutions, including the United States Senate,\\\" the statement continued.  \\\"That a member of the Senate -- at a moment when the Senate is undertaking its most solemn responsibility -- would choose to take to Twitter to spread slander about a member of the military is a testament to cowardice.  While Senator Blackburn fires off defamatory tweets, Lieutenant Colonel Vindman will continue to do what he has always done: serve our country dutifully and with honor. \\\"-- ABC News' Benjamin SiegelOver the past hour, House managers Zoe Lofgren and then Val Demings have laid out in detail Rudy Giuliani's efforts, they argue, to conduct shadow diplomacy in Ukraine to further President Trump's political interests, culminating in the firing of Ambassador Marie Yovanovich. Just as the managers have used Trump's own words against him in clips, this hour of presentation featured multiple videos of Giuliani's prolific media appearances, peddling what Democrats call conspiracy theories, including his comments in this Fox News video clip:\\\"That there were a group of people in the Ukraine working to help Hillary Clinton and were colluding really with the Clinton campaign and it stems around the ambassador and the embassy being used for political purposes.  So I began getting some people that were coming forward and telling me about that.  Then all of a sudden they revealed this story about Burisma and Biden's son and Biden's son being on the board,\\\" Giuliani said in a Fox News appearance. Demings and Lofgren use WhatsApp exchanges provided by indicted Giuliani associated Lev Parnas between himself and Giuliani as more evidence that Giuliani pushed for the firing of Yovanovich. \\\"President Trump removed Ambassador Yovanovitch because she was in the way.  She was in the way of the sham investigations that he so desperately wanted.  Investigations that would hurt former Vice President Biden and undermine the Mueller investigation into Russia election interference.  Investigations that would help him cheat in the 2020 elections,\\\" Demings insisted. And they played the damning bite from EU Ambassador Gordon Sondland, when he admitted that though he believed State Department personnel should take responsibility for Ukraine matters, he felt he had no choice but to conduct diplomacy through Giuliani. \\\"We chose the latter course, not because we liked it, but because it was the only constructive path open to us,\\\" Sondland said in the clip- ABC News' Sarah KolinovskyHouse manager Val Demings of Florida countered the Republican accusation that Democrats are trying to skew the 2020 presidential election away from President Trump. \\\"This trial is much bigger than any one election and it's much bigger than any one president.  This moment is about the American people, this moment is about ensuring that every voter, whether a maid or a janitor, whether a nurse or a teacher or a truck driver, whether a doctor or mechanic, that their vote matters and that American elections are decided by the American people,\\\" she says. Some senators appeared restless as the arguments continued in the afternoon session. GOP Sen.  Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee slid her desk drawer open revealing a copy of “Resistance at All Costs” by Kimberly Strassel. Blackburn also used a blanket to stay warm as did Republican Sen.  Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia. Sen.  Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota enjoyed some chewing gum as she observed Schiff’s performance. Sen.  Richard Burr ordered a glass of milk from a page at 3:31 p. m.  Three minutes later, at 3:34 p. m. , the milk was delivered to his desk, and he quickly chugged more than half before setting it down.  By 3:39 p. m. , the milk was fully consumed and a page quickly cleared his empty glass. I noted at 3:48 p. m.  that every senator was at his or her desk.  None were standing or absent at that point.  Adam Schiff had the room’s full attention. -ABC News' John ParkinsonIt was interesting to watch Schiff seemingly direct parts of his monologue on Ukraine and Russia at Utah Republican Mitt Romney - who is seated in the back row to Schiff’s left. Romney -- famously a Russia hawk -- appeared riveted as Schiff laid out his argument that Trump's actions toward Ukraine implicates Russia and Putin. The two seemed to be making eye contact from my vantage point. Romney was noting line by line down his notepad the enumerated ways that Schiff said Donald Trump “put himself first. ”Overall, the entire chamber seemed to me much more engaged than yesterday afternoon.  Most senators on both sides could be seen watching the Democratic slideshow and taking notes. Only GOP Sen.  Tom Cotton of Arkansas was using a fidget spinner, as far as I could tell. -ABC News' Devin DwyerAs Schiff continues to lay out the Democrats' argument, he targets an expected talking point for the defense -- that Trump was legitimately concerned about corruption within Ukraine. Schiff argues that then-incoming Ukrainian President Zelenskiy had run on a campaign of reforming corruption, so why was it Trump's focus now instead of on the former administration? He adds that President Trump badmouthed U. S.  Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch in his July 25 call with Zelenskiy, despite her reputation for being a strong corruption-fighter in Ukraine. He repeats the point that Trump's interest in Ukraine only came after Joe Biden became a rival candidate for the presidency in 2020. \\\"The evidence is consistent.  It establishes clearly that President Trump did not care about corruption, to the contrary he was pursuing a corrupt aim.  He wanted Ukraine to do the exact thing that American policy officials have tried for years to stop foreign governments from doing - corrupt investigations of political rivals,\\\" Schiff said. Earlier in the afternoon session, Schiff continued to lay out evidence to support the reasons the Democrats say President Trump put his own personal and political interests ahead of his official responsibilities. At one point he scrolled through photos of other presidents on calls with world leaders to make a point that the purpose of those calls is to encourage other countries to do what is in the best interest of the country. Schiff said that when Trump used a call with a foreign leader -- the president of Ukraine--  to push for investigations that would benefit him personally -- it was an abuse of power. \\\"President Trump abused his authority as commander in chief and chief diplomat to benefit himself and he betrayed the interest of the American people when he did so,\\\" Schiff said. To add to his argument, Schiff cited quotes from the president's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, in The New York Times where Giuliani was quoted saying \\\"someone could say it isn't foreign policy and it's improper\\\" and \\\"my only client is the president of the United States. \\\"Several GOP sources tell ABC News that senators are actively considering an abbreviated session this Saturday. The Trump legal team is concerned about their opening arguments getting buried on a Saturday.  The situation is fluid, but these same sources tell ABC that the time frame is roughly 10 a. m.  until possibly 1 p. m. “Save 10-1, expect 10-twelvish,” one senior administration official said. One GOP source said eliminating the Saturday session is also a possibility, but again, the situation is fluid. When asked whether there would be a short session on Saturday, the president personal attorney, Jay Sekulow, says, \\\"The Senate sets the rules on how we go, so we'll see how that goes. \\\"Prior to now, he's said that \\\"we're going to begin our robust case when the Senate says it's time to start. \\\"Sekulow said that if the Senate wants them to go two hours they will, if they want them to go eight hours, fine -- responding to questions about whether they are saving their major presentation for Monday. \\\"I am confident that whether it is Saturday or Monday or Tuesday that the case will be made defending the president.  I have no doubt,\\\" he says. --ABC News' Trish Turner and Katherine Faulders House manager Sylvia Garcia lays out evidence the Democrats' say support that Trump abused his power in pushing for investigations into the Bidens and the Ukrainian energy company Burisma. She says the timeline and lack of evidence that Ukraine interfered in the 2016 election show that Trump's push for the investigations was politically motivated to benefit his campaign and based on Russian misinformation that Ukraine, and not Russia, interfered in American elections. \\\"What is so dangerous is that President Trump is helping them perpetuate this.  Our own president is helping our adversary attack our processes and help his own re-election,\\\" she says. “As soon as President Trump took office, he increased military support to Ukraine in 2017 and in the next year, 2018, but it wasn't until 2019, over three years after Vice President Biden called for Viktor Shokin's removal (Shokin, Ukraine's prosecutor general, was ousted in 2016) --three years after -- that President Trump started pushing Ukraine to investigate his alleged conduct.  So what changed?  What changed?  Why did President Trump not care at all about Biden's request for the removal of Shokin the year after it happened in 2017?  Or the next year in 2018?  Senators, you know what changed in 2019 -when President Trump suddenly cared --  it is that Biden got in the race.  On April 25, Vice President Biden announced he would run for president in 2020,\\\" she says. Fidget spinners --- that’s apparently one thing you can bring into the Senate chamber for a distraction when you're not allowed to have your cell phone or other electronics. As the Democratic arguments continue for a second hour, GOP Sen.  Richard Burr is the only one who has used his -- on and off so far. No milk drinkers yet.  Republican Sen.  Rand Paul has drawn a very impressive sketch of the U. S.  Capitol.  After further examination, however, it appears he is tracing it.  He has placed it on his desk so as to display it to the press above.  It’s the only writing on his white legal pad. GOP Sen.  Marcia Blackburn is reading a novel (it's unclear which one) but the book below the current novel she’s reading is “The Case for Trump. \\\"Republican Sen.  Cindy Hyde-Smith, who is sitting next to Blackburn, has the book “The Chosen” on her desk, but hasn’t started reading it yet. Most senators are taking notes and following along with the presentations.  They have printouts of the slides and video elements the Democrats are using. When the clip of Sen.  Graham was played Graham was the only senator absent from the chamber.  Some Republicans smirked when they looked over and saw he wasn't there. - ABC News' Katherine FauldersNadler boils down the Democratic case to the \\\"ABCs of impeachment. \\\"\\\"Abuse: We will show that President Trump abused his power when he used his office to solicit and pressure Ukraine to meddle in our elections for his personal gain.  Betrayal: We will show that he betrayed vital national interests, specifically our national security, by withholding diplomatic support and military aid from Ukraine even as it faced armed Russian aggression.  Corruption: President Trump's intent was to corrupt our elections to his personal political benefit.  He put his personal interest in retaining power above free and fair elections and above the principle that Americans must govern themselves without interference from abroad. \\\"Article One thus charges a high crime and misdemeanor that blends abuse of power, betrayal of the nation, and corruption in elections into a single unforgiveable scheme.  That is why this president must be removed from office, especially before he continues his effort to corrupt our next election,\\\" Nadler says. Citing legal scholars who agree with the House case, Nadler cites the former Harvard Law School professor who will argue for Trump on the Senate floor that the Constitution does not support that a president can be impeached for abuse of power. \\\"Another who comes to mind is professor Alan Dershowitz.  At least Alan Dershowitz in 1998.  Back then here is what he had to say about impeachment for abuse of power,\\\" Nadler says before showing  a video clip of Dershowitz from 1988. \\\"It certainly doesn't have to be a crime.  If you have somebody who completely corrupts the office of president and who abuses trust and who poses great danger to our liberty, you don't need a technical crime,\\\" Dershowitz says in the clip. \\\"But we need not look to 1998 to find one of President Trump's key allies espousing this view.  Consider the comments of our current Attorney General William Barr, a man known for his extraordinarily expansive view of executive power.  In Attorney General Barr's view, as expressed about 18 months ago, presidents cannot be indicted or criminally investigated, but that's okay because they can impeached.  That's the safeguard,\\\" Nadler says as a memo written by Barr in June 2018 appears in exhibits. \\\"And in an impeachment, Attorney General Barr added, the president is answerable for any abuses of discretion and may be held accountable under law for misdeeds in office.  In other words, Attorney General Barr, who believes along with the office of legal counsel that a president may not be indicted believes that that's okay, we don't need that safeguard against a president who would commit abuses of power.  It's okay because he can be impeached.  That's the safeguard for abuses of discretion and for his misdeeds in office,\\\" Nadler quotes Barr as writing. \\\"When the president betrays our national security and foreign policy interests for his own personal gain, he is unquestionably subject to impeachment and removal,\\\" Nadler continues.  \\\"The same is true of a different concern raised by the framers, the use of presidential power to corrupt the elections and the office of the presidency.  As Madison emphasized, because the presidency was to be administered by a single man, his corruption might be fatal to the republic. \\\"Anticipating another of the arguments from Trump's defense team --- that no specific crime is alleged-- Nadler says, \\\"In a last ditch legal defense of their client, the president's lawyers argue that impeachment and removal are subject to statutory crimes or to offenses against established law, that the president cannot be impeached because he has not committed a crime.  This view is completely wrong.  It has no support in constitutional text and structure, original meeting, congressional presence, common sense or the consensus of credible experts.  In other words, it conflicts with every relevant consideration. \\\"Then, he uses a video clip of GOP Sen.  Lindsey Graham, who had left the chamber. \\\"I might say the same thing of then House manager Lindsey Graham who in President Clinton's trial flatly rejected the notion that impeachable offenses are limited to violation of established law,\\\" Nadler says before playing a clip from Graham on the Senate floor in Clinton's 1999 impeachment trail. \\\"What's a high crime?  How about if an important person hurts somebody of low means?  It's not very scholarly, but I think it's the truth.  I think that's what they meant by high crimes.  Doesn't even have to be a crime.  It's just when you start using your office and you're acting in a way that hurts people, you have committed a high crime,\\\" Graham says in the clip. Rep.  Jerry Nadler, D-N. Y. , one of the lead House impeachment managers takes the floor after Schiff to begin outlining the charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. \\\"President Trump used the powers of his office to solicit a foreign nation to interfere in our elections for his own personal benefit.  Note, that the act of solicitation itself, just the ask, constitutes an abuse of power.  But President Trump went further,\\\" he says. \\\"The president's conduct is wrong.  It is illegal.  It is dangerous, and it captures the worst fears of our founders and the framers of the Constitution,\\\" Nadler says.  \\\"No president has ever used his office to compel a foreign nation to help him cheat in our elections.  Prior presidents would be shocked to the core by such conduct, and rightly so. \\\"This presidential stonewalling of Congress is unprecedented in the 238-year history of our constitutional republic.  It puts even President Nixon to shame.  Taken together, the articles and the evidence conclusively establish that President Trump has placed his own personal political interests first.  He has placed them above our national security, above our free and fair elections, and above our system of checks and balances.  This conduct is not America first, it is Donald Trump first,\\\" Nadler says. \\\"Donald Trump swore an oath to faithfully execute the laws.  That means putting the nation's interests above his own, and the president has repeatedly, flagrantly violated his oath. \\\"Schiff again took the lead as Democrats begin a second of opening arguments. But first he offers some humor, possibly referring to reports of restless senators talking and walking around the chamber -- and some leaving. \\\"I am not sure the chief justice is fully aware of just how rare it is, how extraordinary it is for the House members to be able to command the attention of senators sitting silently for hours or even for minutes for that matter.  Of course, it doesn't hurt that the morning starts out every day with a sergeant at arms warning you that if you don't, you will be imprisoned. \\\"Then he outlines how House managers will go through the first article and what he says are the constitutional underpinnings of abuse of power. \\\"You have now heard hundreds of hours of deposition and live testimony from the House condensed into an abbreviated narrative of the facts.  We will now show you these facts and many others and how they are interwoven.  You will see some of these facts and videos therefore in a new context, in a new light, in the light of what else we know and why it compels a finding of guilt and conviction, so there is some method to our madness. \\\"Sen.  Lindsey Graham, R-S. C. , speaks to reporters shortly before Thursday's proceedings begin, and when asked about a reported he had with Schiff after Wednesday's trial session ended, Graham confirms that he complimented Schiff, a fellow former prosecutor, on his presentation. \\\"He's well-spoken, did a good job of creating a tapestry, taking bits and pieces of evidence and emails and giving a rhetorical flourish making the email come alive,\\\" he says.  \\\"Quite frankly, I thought they did a good job of taking bits and pieces of the evidence and creating a quilt out of it,\\\" he says.  \\\"But will it stand up? \\\"\\\"The point is: let's see what the other side says then we'll make a decision about what the president actually did or didn't do,\\\" he adds.  \\\"All I can do tell you is it from the presidents point of view, he did nothing wrong, in his mind. \\\"\\\"There are bunch of people on my side who want to call Joe Biden and Hunter Biden.  I want to end this thing sooner rather than later,\\\" Graham says, explaining he will not vote for witness and documents.  \\\"I want the American people to pick the next president not me, and so what I think is the best thing to happen is to have oversight of Ukrainian potential misconduct and move on to the election.  I am not going to use my vote to extend the trial,\\\" Graham continues. \\\"I love Joe Biden, but I can tell you, if the name was 'Trump' a lot of questions would be asked. \\\"At a morning news conference, without saying their names, Schumer calls again on four Republican senators -- Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Susan Collins of Maine, Mitt Romney of Utah and Lamar Alexander of Tennessee -- to join Democrats in calling for witnesses and documents, before directly addressing the president and his GOP allies. \\\"I will say this to president than any of my Republican friends: if the American people believe this is not a fair trial, which right now they seem to believe because there were no witnesses and documents, acquittal will have zero value to the president or to the Republicans,\\\"  he says. \\\"The bottom line is the president is clearly covering up, his people are covering up, and the question is: Will our Republican colleagues rise to their constitutional mandate to create a fair trial? \\\" Schumer adds, \\\"and I don't think it will sit very well with history or with the American people if they don't. \\\"Asked about reports of possible deal on witnesses, Schumer says not a single Republican has approached him on the subject -- further shutting down the idea. \\\"No Republicans are talking to us about deals.  We want these four witnesses . . .  they go to the truth,\\\" he says.  (Yesterday, when asked a similar question, Schumer said witnesses should be relevant to the case, seeming to say a deal involving Biden testimony would be off the table for him.

The Bihar Pradesh Congress Committee (BPCC) chief Madan Mohan Jha, however, does not attach much significance to Murari’s meeting with Singh, saying there was nothing objectionable in such meetings. A section of Congress leaders, on the other hand, believe that Murari’s meeting with the JD(U) leader could be viewed in the light of growing dissensions in the party.  A former MLA Bharat Singh had recently claimed that 11 out of Congress’ 19 MLAs were ready to join the National Democratic Alliance (NDA). Jha, however, strongly denied any fear of a spilt in the party, claiming that only ‘weak’ minds could think about it.  Ironically, several Congress MLAs had quit the party and joined the JD(U) just before the assembly elections a couple of months ago. Many party leaders believed that the new All India Congress Committee (AICC) in-charge for Bihar, Bhakta Charan Das, would have a difficult time revitalising the organisation in the face of factional feuds in the party and a fear of split. “As many as seven legislators out of the 19 did not turn up at the BPCC office when Das visited it for the first time as the in-charge.  There were only four MLAs, who took part in the Raj Bhawan march, taken out in support of agitating farmers on January 15, despite instructions from Das,” said a leader, who didn’t wish to be named. Many senior Congress leaders like former Lok Sabha speaker Meira Kumar and former governor Nikhil Kumar hardly visit Sadaquat Ashram—the BPCC headquarter—even on important occasions.  Former BPCC presidents Anil Sharma and Chandan Bagchi are often in news for their reservations. Senior leader and AICC member Kishore Kumar Jha said that the appointment of Das had bolstered the workers’ hope for the organisation’s rejuvenation. “Only elected leaders don’t make the organisation.  Senior leaders, who couldn’t get a chance to fight election or failed in electoral politics, shall also be given due importance for their role in strengthening the party’s roots.  Trusted leaders with credentials shall also be recognised and used in the organisation,” said Jha.

The AICC in-charge has proposed to undertake padyatra in several districts, including Vaishali, Muzaffarpur, Chapra, Siwan, East and West Champaran, Ara, Buxar, Gaya, Jehanabad, Arwal, etc, during his 12-day stay in the state.  Das is arriving in Patna on January 25 and will launch his campaign from January 27 after presiding over the Republic Day celebrations in the BPCC office.  He would wind up his first campaign in the state on February 6. \",\n  \"document_ocr\": \"आदरणीय\\nश्री क्त चण दास\\nजी\\nहार्दिक स्वागत है।\\nकि\\n\",\n  \"Category\": \"Insufficient_Text\"\n}, {\n  \"Id\": 34994,\n  \"claim_image\": \"http://pbs.twimg.com/media/EvJ7WV5UcAQuagc.jpg?format=jpg&name=large\",\n  \"claim\": \"I respect EC's decision, but why break-up the districts.

Banerjee claimed that she was deliberately pushed by some people in Nandigram in East Midnapore hours after she filed her nomination from the assembly constituency on Wednesday. “Cowards have been trying to stop Mamata Banerjee but no one has been able to.  Firstly state ADG Law and Order was removed then DG and now with this. . .  I'm surprised to see how EC, who made all changes, is silent.  They must take responsibility,” Chatterjee, who also holds the state’s parliamentary affairs portfolio, told news agency ANI. The state minister’s remarks came hours after Banerjee claimed that she was pushed by four to five people while she was going to sit in her SUV, following which she also complained of chest pain.  She alleged that there were no local police at the spot.  Banerjee, who was unable to walk properly after the incident, was shifted by her security guards from the front seat to the back seat where she could rest her leg. The chief minister is currently admitted at the SSKM hospital in Kolkata where the doctor, cited by news agency PTI, said Banerjee has sustained severe bone injuries in her left ankle and foot.  Her right shoulder, forearm and neck were also injured, the senior doctor of the state-run SSKM hospital told PTI.  \\\"We will keep her under observation for the next 48 hours.  There will be more tests needed to be done, and after evaluating her condition we will decide on our next course of treatment,\\\" a doctor, part of the team treating Banerjee, was quoted as saying. The chief minister’s colleague and secretary general of West Bengal Trinamool Congress, Chatterjee told ANI that TMC leaders will visit the Election Commission office on Thursday regarding the incident.  “We (TMC party leaders) have decided that tomorrow we will go to the Election Commission and keep this matter in front of the constitutional authority,” he said. While the TMC minister has alleged inaction on EC’s part, the poll body has sought a report from the state police on the alleged attack, according to PTI. After the incident last evening, several TMC leaders alleged that the chief minister was being attacked by goons as many people, in an apparent reference to the opposition in the state, don't want her to campaign for the elections. “They want her to be removed from their path.  That is why she has been attacked by goons.  People will give a befitting reply,\\\" state minister and senior TMC leader Subrata Mukherjee was quoted by PTI. Meanwhile, the BJP termed it an accident and demanded a probe by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) as they alleged Banerjee was trying to turn it into \\\"pre-planned conspiracy,\\\" according to PTI. \\\"It can happen that she met with an accident but to claim that she was deliberately pushed is not acceptable.  She has a lot of security personnel guarding her round the clock,\\\" BJP's national general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya was quoted as saying. \",\n  \"document_ocr\": \"\",\n  \"Category\": \"Insufficient_Text\"\n}, {\n  \"Id\": 34995,\n  \"claim_image\": \"http://pbs.twimg.com/media/ExJgySlVEAYtBSJ.jpg?format=jpg&name=large\",\n  \"claim\": \"Tamil Nadu: Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) chief MK Stalin holds door to door campaign in Krishnagiri.\\n\\nTamil Nadu to go to polls in single phase on April 6 https://t.co/YyJq5pysLq\",\n  \"claim_ocr\": \"ANI\\nATHF FICKION\\n\",\n  \"document_image\": \"http://pbs.twimg.com/media/EvSBqg8VEAQqaRO.png?format=jpg&name=large\",\n  \"document\": \"Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra will visit Assam on Monday (March 1) to campaign for party candidates for upcoming Assembly election.

Vadra will be campaigning in other parts of upper Assam, including Tezpur, where she will address a rally on March 2.  She will be in the state for two days.

However, she did campaign for former Silchar MP Sushmita Dev ahead of 2019 elections. Besides Assam, the state Congress units in other poll-bound states also want Vadra to campaign for their candidates.  Kerala state unit has already sent a proposal to the general secretary in-charge of the state mentioning the campaign dates of Priyanka Gandhi Vadra. Meanwhile, Rahul Gandhi had visited Assam earlier this month and addressed a rally in which he gave a message that Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) will be highlighted as the main agenda from Congress party's side. Gandhi had even worn a scarf depicting his anti-CAA stand symbolically in which he had said, \\\"Hum ne yeh gamchha pehna hai.  Ispe likha hai CAA.

Two Indian flights carried two million doses of Covishield to Dhaka and one million doses to Kathmandu, and people familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity that supplies would be sent to Seychelles (50,000 doses), Mauritius (100,000 doses) and Myanmar (1. 5 million doses) on Friday. Seven countries – Bhutan, the Maldives, Bangladesh, Nepal, Seychelles, Myanmar and Mauritius – are part of India’s initial rollout of vaccines as grant assistance.  There are also plans to supply doses to Afghanistan and Sri Lanka. The people added commercial supplies of Covishield to several countries that have agreements with the Serum Institute of India will also begin from Friday.  Two flights will carry two million doses each to Brazil and Morocco early on Friday morning. After a phone conversation with his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi, Pakistan foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi announced on Thursday that Beijing had gifted 500,000 doses of the Sinopharm vaccine as aid. “I want to give the nation the good news that China has promised to immediately provide 500,000 doses of vaccine to Pakistan by January 31,” Qureshi said.  “They (China) have said you can send your airplane and immediately airlift this drug,”Qureshi quoted Wang as saying that Pakistan was the first country China thought of assisting with vaccines in view of their \\\"all-weather strategic relationship\\\".  He also said China would supply more than a million doses by February. Pakistan is currently the world’s most populous country that hasn’t rolled out a vaccination programme.  It is also the only country in the region to have approved the Sinopharm vaccine for emergency use.  The approval for Sinopharm earlier this week came days after Pakistan cleared the AstraZeneca vaccine. The two million doses gifted by India to Bangladesh were handed over by Indian envoy Vikram Doraiswami to foreign minister AK Abdul Momen and health minister Zahid Maleque in Dhaka.  This was the single largest consignment of vaccines provided by India to any country so far. Momen said India had stood by Bangladesh during the Liberation War of 1971 as well as the pandemic that had impacted the world.  “This proves the true friendship between Bangladesh and India,” he said. India’s vaccine assistance reached Nepal within a week of a request made by visiting Nepalese foreign minister Pradeep Gyawali during a visit to New Delhi last week.  While handing over the supplies to Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli in Kathmandu, Indian envoy Vinay Mohan Kwatra said this reflected “India’s Neighbourhood First policy in action”. Oli thanked Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the Indian government for the “generous grant of one million doses of Covid vaccine to Nepal at this critical time when India is rolling out vaccination for its own people”. Observers have noted that India speedily rolled out millions of doses as aid despite the massive requirements of its own vaccination drive that began on January 16.  The assistance came against the backdrop of China’s efforts to forge cooperation in fighting Covid-19 within South Asia by holding meetings with Pakistan, Afghanistan, Nepal, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh since last year. Former ambassador Vishnu Prakash lauded the alacrity with which the Indian government had responded to the needs of its neighbours, saying it was in line with its efforts to be the first responder in all emergency situations. “This is my definition of the Neighbourhood First policy.  It is the kind of policy and approach that we need to follow and its shows the difference between India and other countries.  I can’t think of such selflessness by any other country in an hour of need. ”Observers have noted that India speedily rolled out millions of doses as aid despite the massive requirements of its own vaccination drive that began on January 16.

If Trump blocked people in his personal capacity, “it is curious to me that the Justice Department is here representing him,” Judge Peter Hall said in response to the government’s attorney, Jennifer Utrecht. \\n\\n  “Your very presence here represents that this” – an apparent reference to Twitter – “is a public forum,” Hall added. \\n\\n  Utrecht said the department was representing the President because Trump had been sued in his official capacity. \\n\\n  Last year, a New York federal judge ruled that Trump had violated the Constitution when he blocked Twitter users.  \\n\\n  US District Judge Naomi Reice Buchwald wrote in her ruling that “no government official – including the President – is above the law, and all government officials are presumed to follow the law as has been declared. ” \\n\\n  “We hold that portions of the @realDonaldTrump account – the ‘interactive space’ where Twitter users may directly engage with the content of the President’s tweets – are properly analyzed under the ‘public forum’ doctrines set forth by the Supreme Court, that such space is a designated public forum, and that the blocking of the plaintiffs based on their political speech constitutes viewpoint discrimination that violates the First Amendment,” Buchwald wrote.  \\n\\n  On Tuesday, Utrecht argued that though Trump tweets in his official capacity, he blocks users as a personal matter.  Judge Christopher Droney listed recent tweets by the President, including one that revoked sanctions on North Korea, another concerning the Golan Heights territory and a third on the Federal Reserve Board.  \\n\\n  “Those aren’t official actions? ” the judge asked.  \\n\\n  Utrecht said they were, but later said: “The President, when he blocks individuals from his personal Twitter account … is doing so in his personal capacity. ” That prompted one judge to ask if Trump himself, rather than a personal aide or government staffer, is “entering the blocks. ” Utrecht replied that he is, an admission the government had also made in a stipulation.  \\n\\n  In his argument, Jaffer warned of a slippery slope if the court were to find that Trump could block certain users while occupying the White House.  \\n\\n  Raising the notion of a President preventing certain commenters from posting on a government website, Jaffer said, “I think you would be opening the door to the distortion and manipulation of those types of spaces as well if you were to accept this argument. ” \\n\\n  “The whole point of Twitter is to facilitate interaction among users,” he said.  “If the government had wanted one-way action, it could have used a blog” or another platform for Trump’s comments.  \\n\\n  CNN’s Kate Sullivan and Tom Kludt contributed to this report.  \\n© 2021 Cable News Network.

People above 60 years of age,who make up 10% of the country’s population, account for 50% of the 5,598 Covid-19 deaths recorded in India.  Of these, 38% belong to the 60 and 74 years age group.  Patients who were aged above 75 years old account for 12% of the deaths, the data shows.  The data that the ministry released on April 30 showed 34. 8% deaths were recorded in 45- 60 year age group.  “There is enough data being generated that people who are elderly (above 60 years of age), and those who suffer from some kind of underlying medical condition such as hypertension, diabetes or respiratory illness are at high risk and need to be extra careful as they are at a higher risk of developing severe form of disease,” said Lav Agarwal, joint secretary, health ministry, at a press briefing. According to the health ministry’s analysis of the deaths, 73% of the Covid deaths are of patients with underlying medical conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular and respiratory disease.  “This section of population needs to keep their symptoms under control by taking regular medicines, consulting their doctor on time, taking preventive measures such as not stepping out of the house, if not necessary, and wearing a mask, following hand hygiene etc. ,” Agarwal added.  In terms of deaths per 100,000 population, India has fatality rate 0. 41 as opposed to 4. 9 globally. “India’s death rate is probably the lowest in the world, and that is enough to speak for how the country has managed its cases far better than some of the most developed countries in the world.  Also, India’s case fatality rate has been steadily declining since past two months.  In mid April it was around 3. 3%, then it dropped to 3. 25%, later to 3. 15%, and as on today we stand at 2. 82%, even then we can’t let our guard drop, and taking precautions must be turned into a habit,” Agarwal said. “If you look at individual countries, some countries have even reported as high as 82 deaths per lakh population.  This says how our focus on early case detection, and robust contact tracing in containment zones has been in the right direction, and it will continue to be our main strategy in future also, along with ramping up the Covid testing capacity,” Agarwal added. Experts say focusing on the elderly and people suffering from non-communicable diseases (NCDs) is important as this section is more vulnerable to Covid-19. “People with major NCDs need regular care, and are likely to develop severe form of illness because of their co-morbid conditions, which is why we are working on reference guidelines for patients, doctors and other support staff to look for ways to reduce morbidity and mortality among this group, ” says Dr Prashant Mathur, director, The National Centre for Disease Informatics and Research (NCDIR).  India’s daily Covid testing capacity at the moment is about 140,000 samples; and the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) is aiming to scale it up to about 200,000 samples a day in the next two weeks. “In past two months our focus has been to scale up testing, and we have managed to go from about a 100 labs in March to about 681 functional laboratories currently, of which 476 are government labs and 205 are private testing labs.  Around the end of March we were doing about 20-25,000 samples in a day in India, and for the past few days the number on average is about 1. 20 lakh samples a day,” said Dr Nivedita Gupta, scientist (epidemiology division), ICMR. “There was shortage of supplies felt when we started out testing for Covid because there was a global demand for these supplies.  Today, we have managed to handhold many indigenous manufacturers who are capable producing kits in bulk.  We also use RT-PCR testing kits of at least 11-12 domestic manufacturers for testing, making us far more comfortable in terms of testing huge numbers in a short span of time than we were a few months ago,” she said. RT-PCR is short for Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction, known as the gold standard among Covid-19 tests. One of the private lab owners, on condition of anonymity, said, “It’s good to encourage indigenous manufacturers; however, we have to also ensure quality of products such as testing kits, swab sticks, viral transport medium that is being manufactured domestically.  If the quality isn’t maintained then people will keep going for imported products. ”\",\n  \"document_ocr\": \"की ज की आवश्यकता है?\\nবग बटर में गांप्क करे।\\n\",\n  \"Category\": \"Insufficient_Text\"\n}];\nexport default factify;","map":{"version":3,"names":["factify"],"sources":["/Users/jinendramalekar/Desktop/Factify/src/train.js"],"sourcesContent":["const factify=[{\"Id\":34839,\"claim_image\":\"http://pbs.twimg.com/media/D0bHdfNVAAESFVP.jpg?format=jpg&name=large\",\"claim\":\"Michael Cohen apologizes for lying to Congress: \\\"I have done some real soul searching, and I see now that my ambition and the intoxication of Trump power had much to do with the bad decisions in part that I made.\\\" https://t.co/bGOQwKc1vW https://t.co/ZaPsCCVJff\",\"claim_ocr\":\"abc\\nNEWS\\niCAPIT\\nARCHITE\\nALE\\n\",\"document_image\":\"http://pbs.twimg.com/media/D0bxxSUWsAMs09t.jpg?format=jpg&name=large\",\"document\":\"\\n  President Donald Trump’s former lawyer, Michael Cohen, denied on Wednesday that he wanted a job at the White House after Trump was elected in 2016. \\n\\n  “I was extremely proud to be the personal attorney for the President of the United States of America.  I did not want to go to the White House.  I was offered jobs,” Cohen claimed. \\n\\n  “I can tell you a story of Mr.  Trump reaming out (former White House Chief of Staff) Reince Priebus because I had not taken a job where Mr.  Trump wanted me to, which was working with (former White House Counsel) Don McGahn in the White House Counsel office,” Cohen continued.  “What I said at the time – and I brought a lawyer in who produced a memo as to why I should not go in because there would be no attorney-client privilege – and in order to handle some of the matters I talked about in my opening that it would be best suited for me not to go in and the every President had a personal attorney. ”\\n\\n  Priebus provided no comment to CNN regarding Cohen’s claim.  \\n\\n  Cohen, later in his testimony, told Congress that he saw with Trump and an attorney to discuss staying on as Trump’s personal attorney following the inauguration. \\n\\n  “I did not want to go to the White House,” Cohen reasserted.  “I retained, I brought an attorney in, and I sat with Mr.  Trump, with him for well over an hour, explaining the importance of having a personal attorney, that every president has had one in order to handle matters like the matters I was dealing with. ”\\n\\n  However, over the last year, sources have told CNN that Cohen wanted a job at the White House but was edged out by Trump’s family. \\n\\n  Cohen was named personal attorney to the President in a bid to mollify him after he was not offered a position at the White House, sources familiar with the matter said.  But there is no indication he performed any legal work for Trump after he was inaugurated and he was not a member of the legal team representing him in the special counsel’s investigation. \\n\\n  Cohen on Wednesday provided Congress checks that were given to him over a “retainer” period, one of which was signed by Trump.  But Cohen conceded that there was no retainer agreement for his legal services, and the retainer payments were, in part, reimbursements for payments to Stephanie Clifford, known also as Stormy Daniels, who was compensated as part of a hush agreement over an alleged affair between Daniels and Trump. \\n\\n  In addition, several people familiar told CNN that Cohen told associates he believed he could be named White House chief of staff.  Cohen was crushed when he was not offered the job, which went to Priebus, the sources said. \\n\\nCNN reported in May that Trump’s daughter, Ivanka Trump and Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, sought to keep Cohen away from a White House job, and he was rarely seen there following the inauguration.  The proximity that Cohen initially had to Trump during the transition greatly weakened after Inauguration Day, multiple people told CNN at the time.   One person described Cohen as having become “disenfranchised” in the early months of the Trump administration – but that he nevertheless continued to portray himself as Trump’s go-to guy. \\n\\n  The President’s sons, Donald Trump Jr.  and Eric Trump, also disputed Cohen’s claim that he did not want a White House job.  \\n\\n  “Michael was lobbying EVERYONE to be ‘Chief of Staff. ’ It was the biggest joke in the campaign and around the office.  Did he just perjure himself again? ” Eric Trump asked on Twitter Wednesday morning.  \\n\\n  Donald Trump Jr.  responded, writing that Eric “nailed it. ” \\n\\n  “It really was the biggest joke of the entire transition.

Edited Excerpts:There was major meeting of opposition chief ministers and Congress chief Sonia Gandhi on Wednesday.  The decision to hold the NEET and JEE exams has clearly become a major political issue. It pains to see that education is becoming politicised.  I request my colleagues across the political spectrum to abide by the orders of the honourable Supreme Court.  Leaving the politics aside, I would like to share that, a total of 7. 41 lakh candidates out of 8. 58 lakh appearing for JEE have downloaded admit cards.  Only 332 candidates have requested for change of their centre cities, which are being considered positively.  In reference to NEET, a total of 6. 84 lakh candidates (out of a total of 15. 97 lakh) have downloaded the admit cards in the first five hours.  West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee has said that if you don’t understand students’ problems, and that they will approach the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court, while dismissing the writ petition regarding the postponement of these examinations, also observed, inter alia, the following: “Ultimately life has to go on, and the career of the students cannot be put on peril for long and a full academic year cannot be wasted”.  I would like to state that Parliament will start functioning, offices are functioning.  In my opinion we have to ensure that there is no zero academic year in the lives of students.  Some students say that the government isn’t being considerate, and it isn’t responding to an unprecedented situation and the plight of students. I feel that this government is very empathetic and considerate to the cause of the students.  Academic career is very important, and a zero academic year will cause tremendous loss to the students. Every day, I get innumerable mails from the silent majority .  The parents and students say that they are under stress and preparing for exams for the last two to three years and that they don’t want a zero academic year.  They have been seriously preparing for the exams since January and the past two years.  My request to all parents and students is to have faith in us about the safety of the examination centres.  Is it not possible to move the exams ahead by another 30 or 60 days?  Are you considering any such move? There is no certainty about when the pandemic will.  The solution therefore is to move on with precautions.  Why is there no other alternative being considered -- online entrance examinations, or normalising of marks from different board exams to facilitate direct selection? We need to have a transparent system of selection of students into the higher education system.  The most transparent system is an objective test, and this has evolved over the years.  If we tinker with the system and selection process, it is going to cause irreparable damage to the careers of the students.  I have always reiterated that safety first and then exams.  But conducting these exams any time later might lead to a situation where the entire year could be lost, therefore conducting these exams in now with due precautions is a middle path.  What about students who don’t get centres of their choice -- how will they travel to the exam centre with transport and travel restrictions in various places? In the best interest of students, NTA has ensured that more than 99% candidates get their first choice of centre and cities in of these examinations.  The number of centres have been increased from 570 to 660 (in case of JEE Main) and 2,546 to 3,843 (in case of NEET).  In case of JEE Main, the number of shifts has been increased from the earlier 8 to 12, and the number of candidates per shift has been reduced from earlier 1. 32 lakh to 85,000.

Two nurses were also killed in the incident. At least 27 patients were undergoing treatment in the ICU of Patel Welfare Hospital and nearly 60 other patients were admitted in other wards when the fire erupted at midnight, police said. The hospital is located on Bharuch-Jambusar highway, nearly 200 km from Ahmedabad. While the exact cause of the fire is yet to be ascertained, fire department officials suspect a leak in an oxygen cylinder may have led to the fire. The fire was controlled within an hour and around 50 patients were shifted to nearby hospitals, officials said. Officials in the fire department said that the building where the blaze erupted did not possess a no objection certificate (NOC) for fire safety. “The hospital has two buildings.  While the one where the incident occurred, did not have an NOC, another building had the document,” Bharuch regional fire officer Deepak Makhija told reporters. Offering his condolences to the kin of the deceased, Gujarat chief minister Vijay Rupani announced an ex-gratia of Rs. 4 lakh to the families of each of the deceased. “I express my condolences to those who lost their lives in the fire at Bharuch hospital.  The state government will provide assistance of ₹4 lakh to the families of each of the victims of the accident,” the chief minister said.  The state government has ordered a judicial inquiry into the incident. Two IAS officers, additional chief secretary (ACS), labour and employment, Vipul Mitra, and commissioner, municipalities administration, Raj Kumar Beniwal, were directed to probe the incident.  The two have already left for Bharuch. Earlier on March 26, four patients died while shifting after a fire broke out at a hospital in Surat. \",\"document_ocr\":\"\",\"Category\":\"Insufficient_Text\"},{\"Id\":34842,\"claim_image\":\"http://pbs.twimg.com/media/EZ7rEncUYAEj6Bh.jpg?format=jpg&name=large\",\"claim\":\"Guwahati: A leopard was beaten to death by locals in Katahbari area of Gorchuk yesterday.

It did not elaborate on where or when the alleged leader of the opposition royalist group known as the Kingdom Assembly of Iran, or Tondar (Farsi for Thunder), was detained. Iran slammed its arch enemy the United States for hosting Sharmahd and “supporting known terrorists who have claimed responsiblity for several terrorist acts inside” the country. “This regime must answer for its support of this terrorist group and other groups and criminals who orchestrate armed, sabotage and terrorist operations against the people of Iran from inside America and spill Iranians’ blood,” a foreign ministry statement said. The intelligence ministry said Sharmahd had orchestrated the April 12, 2008 bombing in a packed mosque in Shiraz that killed 14 people and wounded 215. A US State Department spokesperson said “the Iranian regime has a long history of detaining Iranians and foreign nationals on spurious charges”. “We urge Iran to be fully transparent and abide by all international legal standards. ”Mosque bombing Iran hanged three men convicted of the bombing in 2009, saying they had ties to the monarchist group. The three men said they had been taking orders from an Iranian US-backed “CIA agent” identified at the time only as “Jamshid” to try to assassinate a high-ranking official in Iran, Fars news agency reported at the time. They were 21-year-old Mohsen Eslamian and Ali Asghar Pashtar, 20 -- both university students -- as well as Rouzbeh Yahyazadeh, 32. The three were found guilty of being “mohareb” (enemies of God) and “corruption on earth” by a revolutionary court in Tehran. Iran in 2010 hanged two other convicted members of the group, who had “confessed to obtaining explosives and planning to assassinate officials”. The statement issued on Saturday said that Tondar had plotted several other “big operations” which failed. It said that Tondar had planned to blow up a dam in Shiraz, use “cyanide bombs” at a Tehran book fair, and plant an explosive device at the mausoleum of the Islamic republic’s founder, the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. Iran’s intelligence ministry published a picture later on Saturday of a grey-haired man in a blindfold it said was Sharmahd.  It did not say where or when the photo was taken. ‘Complicated operation’It was not clear how Iran arrested Sharmahd, who has generally been based in the US, in what its intelligence ministry called a “complicated operation”. According to the association’s website, Sharmahd was born in Tehran in 1955 and grew up in an Iranian-German family before moving to the United States in 2003, where he started to voice anti-Islam and anti-Islamic republic statements. Tondar rejects the Iranian political system and campaigns to overthrow the Islamic republic and re-establish a monarchy similar to that of Cyrus the Great. Iran announced the arrest of a former opposition figure in similarly mysterious circumstances in October last year. It said Ruhollah Zam was arrested in a “sophisticated and professional operation”. Zam, described by Iran’s Revolutionary Guards as a “counter-revolutionary” who was “directed by France’s intelligence service”, was sentenced to death in June over “corruption on earth”. Zam, who reportedly lived in exile in Paris, ran a channel on the Telegram messaging application called Amadnews and was accused of sparking unrest during anti-government protests in 2017-18. The Islamic republic also captured the head of a Sunni Muslim rebel group in a dramatic operation in 2010 and executed him in the same year, boasting of its reach in capturing adversarial figures. Abdolmalek Rigi was arrested while on a flight from Dubai to Kyrgyzstan, when Iranian warplanes forced the plane he was travelling on to land in Iran. The rebel group Jundallah (Soldiers of God) had waged a deadly insurgency in Shiite Iran’s southeastern province of Sistan and Baluchistan for a decade before it was severely weakened by Rigi’s execution. \",\"document_ocr\":\"\",\"Category\":\"Insufficient_Text\"},{\"Id\":34843,\"claim_image\":\"http://pbs.twimg.com/media/D2edUsDWsAAgz6W.jpg?format=jpg&name=large\",\"claim\":\"Republicans feel as vindicated as Democrats feel frustrated following Mueller's findings https://t.co/TqeOLgAgLc https://t.co/PweTdL4o8b\",\"claim_ocr\":\"determined not to make a trad erning\\ner of indictments and convictions of individuals and\\nall of which have been publicly disclosed.

Russia reacts cautiously to Mueller report findingsMOSCOW -- The Kremlin has responded cautiously to the conclusion of special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation that found no evidence of a conspiracy by Donald Trump's presidential campaign to help Russia interfere in the 2016 U. S.  election. Russian President Vladimir Putin’s spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Monday he couldn't comment on Mueller's findings since no one had seen the report in full, and he denied again that Russia had meddled in 2016. \\\"We haven’t seen the report itself,\\\" Peskov said in a daily briefing call with reporters.  \\\"We have seen a certain condensed version, a summary, which, moreover, tells nothing new, except the acknowledgment of the absence of any conspiracy. \\\"Reiterating Russia's long-standing blanket denial that it had interfered in the 2016 election, Peskov said of Mueller's investigation, \\\"It's hard to find a black cat in a dark room, especially if it's not there. \\\"Attorney General William Barr on Sunday released a summary of the key findings of Mueller’s 22-month investigation into Russia's effort to influence the 2016 election.  In a letter to Congress, Barr quoted from Mueller's own report that the special counsel had found no evidence that Trump or anyone associated with his campaign had conspired with Russia, \\\"despite multiple offers from Russian-affiliated individuals to assist the Trump campaign. \\\"Peskov denied that Russia had sought to aid Trump or meddled in 2016 in any way.  He also rejected Mueller's finding that Moscow mounted a two-pronged influence operation targeting American social media and a hacking attack that stole and then leaked documents from the Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton's campaign. Other Russian officials' reactions were far more strident, however. Russia's foreign ministry criticized Mueller’s investigation in a Monday statement as a waste of time and resources, and said the accusation of Russian meddling was an \\\"obvious fake. \\\"\\\"The long-awaited Mueller report has proved what we in Russia knew from the very beginning: there was no conspiracy between Trump and someone from his team with the Kremlin,\\\" Kostantin Kosachev, a prominent senator who chairs Russia's senate committee on foreign affairs, wrote on his Facebook page, condemning what he said had been \\\"two years of ceaseless lies. \\\"Meanwhile, anchors on the main state news channel, Russia 24,  mocked how much time and space American media had given to what they called a \\\"fake. \\\"Mueller’s investigation saw 34 people charged, among them six Trump aides and advisers.  Twenty-five Russians, many of them military intelligence officers, were indicted for their role in the hack of Democratic party institutions, or for taking part in the social media campaign.  In those indictments, Mueller laid out how the Russia’s intelligence services and a so-called \\\"troll factory\\\" in Saint Petersburg had sought to influence the U. S.  electorate. Russian officials and state media for two years have insisted the accusations of election meddling are fantasies invented by the Democrats to be used as a pretext to sanction Moscow.  Despite Barr's letter stating the opposite, Russian officials on Monday portrayed Trump's clearing of collusion as also proving there had been no Russian interference of any kind. The Russian foreign ministry on Monday attacked the Obama administration, accusing it of trying \\\"to discredit Trump\\\" in 2016 by making \\\"unfounded accusations of 'hacking attacks. '\\\"The Obama administration in 2016 agonized over how to make Russia's election operations public, worrying over just such an accusation of partisan bias, former administration officials have since said.  After Republican leaders rejected a request to make a partisan statement calling out the Russian campaign, in the end, the Department of Homeland Security and the Office of the Director of National intelligence released a joint statement in October 2016 noting the Russian efforts, but leaving out whether the Russians had sought to help a particular candidate. With Mueller's investigation now over, some Russian senators said they hoped Trump might now try to improve relations with Russia, but they expressed doubts, saying they feared instead fresh sanctions were more likely to follow. \\\"We in Russia have little to celebrate,\\\" Kosachev wrote, saying he believed Congress would now argue that even without a conspiracy it was necessary to strengthen sanctions against Russia. \\\"There is a chance to reset much in our relations, but whether Trump will risk it remains an open question.  We, obviously, are ready,\\\" Kosachev wrote, adding Trump should use the moment to begin negotiations on two key arms agreements, the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces and the START treaties. Russia and the U. S.  in any case are at loggerheads in many areas unrelated to the 2016 election-- from Syria to Venezuela. Maria Lipman, a veteran Russian journalist and editor of the Counterpoint journal, agreed it was unlikely that Mueller's conclusion would ease the confrontation.  Having used Russia as \\\"a battering ram against Trump\\\" for the past two years, she said, it would be hard for Democrats to now put it aside and that the portrayal of one another in both countries was so negative that little could change in the short term. \\\"The antagonism between Russia and the U. S.  has become so deep that I don't think there can be any improvement.  I don't think we should expect any change,\\\" she said. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events\",\"document_ocr\":\"HN'S CHL\\nC000\\nTasos Katopodis/Getty Images\\n\",\"Category\":\"Insufficient_Text\"},{\"Id\":34844,\"claim_image\":\"http://pbs.twimg.com/media/E1mjW_LUYAA80-H.jpg?format=jpg&name=large\",\"claim\":\"South Korea's daily #COVID19 cases stayed in 600s for 3rd consecutive day today, as infections from pvt gatherings, schools &amp; military bases continued.

While seven passengers were rescued, the driver and at least five others were missing till the time of going to press.

The accident took place in Piprav village of the district while the bus was on its way from Sidhi to Satna. “…it was found that the driver took a short route as there was a traffic jam on the regular road. . . The job aspirants, who were in the bus, were requesting the driver to increase the speed as they were getting late for the exam.

Loniya informed the others that a bus has fallen into the canal. ”The bus was running at a very high speed when the driver lost the control, Loniya told reporters at the accident site.  “…we jumped into the canal to save the passengers, but could save only seven people who managed to come out of the bus,” she said.

Earlier, around 25,000 to 30,000 pilgrims would throng the cave shrine per day.  “From 5am to 6pm on Tuesday, 11,400 pilgrims had obtained yatra slips—4,400 offline and 7,000 online.  The figures are significantly low as compared to the pre-pandemic time,”an official said.  Last year, the shrine had been closed on March 18 and re-opened on August 16 after a hiatus of almost five months.  A health official said 71 travellers had tested positive in Katra on the first day of the festival.  “On Tuesday, we detected 85 new cases in Reasi, which included 71 travellers, 11 locals and two staff members.  So far, 498 people have tested positive in Reasi,” he said.  The travellers who tested positive were either sent back in specially designed cabs to Pathankot or kept in isolation.  “Largely, travellers who tested positive preferred to return home, for which the administration has kept seven to eight cabs.  For those, who choose to remain at Katra, the administration has the provision of paid quarantine in Katra and government quarantine at Panthal,” the official said.  Sources within shrine board said inviting devotional singers while the second wave of the pandemic is sweeping through the UT was irrational.  “Considering the surge in cases, the morning and evening aartis should have been left to the priests and singers of the shrine board,” they said.  At 5,200ft, the cave shrine is one of the holiest Hindu pilgrimages and devotees from all over the country and abroad visit the shrine on auspicious days.  The administration has fixed a ceiling of 25,000 pilgrims a day.  Pilgrims arriving in trains to Katra will undergo rapid antigen tests (RATs) at the Katra railway station where Covid kiosks have been set up.  Those arriving via road will undergo the test at Lakhanpur—the gateway to Jammu and Kashmir.  Local devotees will be tested at Banganga and flying in will be tested at the Jammu airport.  However, it is advisable for pilgrims coming from outside J&K to bring their Covid-19 negative reports, preferably RT-PCR test, not older than 72 hours.  The cave shrine was visited by 13,089 pilgrims on April 11.  Last year, in August, the figures had dipped to 7,253 and 27,427 in September before picking up momentum in October when 1,21,661 pilgrims visited the shrine followed by 1,03,749 devotees in November and 2,07,533 in December.  In January, 4,08,061 pilgrims had visited the shrine, 3,89,549 in February and in March the count was around 3. 5 lakh.  Meanwhile, shat chandi maha yagya commenced at the cave shrine on first day of the festival amid chanting of vedic mantras and performance of other religious ceremonies.  The maha yagya, which is being performed during navratras for peace, prosperity and health of humanity, will conclude with a purna ahuti on Ramanavami.  Board CEO Ramesh Kumar said elaborate arrangements have been made to facilitate the pilgrims who are expected to visit the holy cave shrine.  \",\"document_ocr\":\"Ravneet Singh Bittu\\n1 hr O\\nAs it is being shown in the media, It is true that i have tested positive for corona.

According to the modified version of the scheme—Emergency Credit Line Guarantee Scheme (ECLGS 4. 0)—100% guarantee cover will be available to loans up to ₹2 crore to hospitals, nursing homes, clinics and medical colleges for setting up on-site oxygen generation plants with an interest rate cap at 7. 5%. “The ECLGS 4. 0 will further facilitate flow of institutional credit at reasonable terms to MSMEs,” a finance ministry spokesperson said. The ₹3 lakh crore ECLGS is one of the key components of the ₹20 lakh crore economic stimulus package launched in mid-May last year that offered additional working capital finance in the form of an easy term loan to small firms. The scheme also included the ailing civil aviation sector and further liberalised credit terms for existing beneficiaries. Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman’s office said in a tweet that the civil aviation sector would also be eligible to avail the easy credit under the scheme, and the validity of ECLGS was extended to September 30 or till guarantees for an amount of ₹3 lakh crore are issued.  Credit disbursements under the scheme are, however, permitted up to December 31, 2021. Earlier on March 31, the government had extended the scheme till June 30, but the industry wanted it to be extended till March 31, 2022, with an additional corpus of ₹3 lakh crore as the scheme was left with limited money. According to the banking industry, ECLGS has already exhausted ₹2. 54 lakh crore from the existing corpus of ₹3 lakh crore, and only about ₹46,000 crore is now available under the scheme.  The official quoted above said: “The government may enhance the corpus depending on its demand. ”The modified scheme—ECLGS 4. 0—has provided one-year additional tenure to borrowers who availed its credit facility last year under ECLGS 1. 0.  It has also relaxed various other conditions. “The modifications in ECLGS, would enhance the utility and impact of ECLGS by providing additional support to MSMEs, safeguarding livelihoods and helping in seamless resumption of business activity,” the finance ministry said in a statement. “The move aims at providing stimulus to the MSME sector, a worst sufferer of the second wave of Covid-19 pandemic.  More relief for MSMEs are expected after extensive consultations with stakeholders,” one official, aware of the development, said on condition of anonymity. Hindustan Times on May 21 wrote that the government was considering various support measures for MSMEs, including expanding the scope and tenure of ECLGS. \",\"document_ocr\":\"\",\"Category\":\"Insufficient_Text\"},{\"Id\":34855,\"claim_image\":\"http://pbs.twimg.com/media/EZ-dOIRWsAAakpE.jpg?format=jpg&name=large\",\"claim\":\"Low-intensity earthquake of magnitude 2.1 hits Delhi: Report\\n\\nhttps://t.co/pgr5PASDhe https://t.co/hKsDC71Zbc\",\"claim_ocr\":\"\",\"document_image\":\"http://pbs.twimg.com/amplify_video_thumb/1293399460714881026/img/seLtNuR_lWPjmTTe.jpg?format=jpg&name=large\",\"document\":\"A low-intensity earthquake of magnitude 2. 1 has hit Delhi, news agency PTI reported on Monday, quoting the National Centre for Seismology (NCS).

Since April, Delhi-NCR has recorded more than 14 quakes of low and medium intensity, PTI reported. Twin earthquakes within an hour shook Haryana late last month.  The tremors were felt in Delhi too. The first one, a 4-5 magnitude quake, was reported in Rohtak at 9 pm and the second one struck at 10 pm on May 29.  Both the earthquakes were shallow. A 2. 5 magnitude earthquake with its epicentre in Faridabad district was recorded by the National Centre for Seismology at 4. 24 pm a day before evening.

Two earthquakes were also reported on two consecutive days in Delhi in April. Delhi falls under the fourth-highest zone in India, making it vulnerable to earthquakes.  But there haven’t been too many earthquakes which have its epicentre in the national capital.  Delhi mostly experiences tremors when a quake hits regions as far as central Asia or the Himalayan ranges, known to be a high-seismic zone. Seismologists, however, say that it is not unusual for the epicentre of these relatively small earthquakes to be in Delhi and neighbouring Haryana, seismologists said. They also say that a larger proportion of people have been feeling the earthquake because most people are at home and there is far less noise associated with traffic movement due to the ongoing Covid-19 lockdown. \",\"document_ocr\":\"ANI\\n\",\"Category\":\"Insufficient_Text\"},{\"Id\":34856,\"claim_image\":\"http://pbs.twimg.com/media/EA4JF7PXYAAKVA0.jpg?format=jpg&name=large\",\"claim\":\"Ayodhya land case: The three member mediation panel has submitted its report in a sealed cover to the Supreme Court https://t.co/Ij62lI9Jgl\",\"claim_ocr\":\"ANI\\nnews\\nflash\\n\",\"document_image\":\"http://pbs.twimg.com/media/EA3d1HjU0AEWtGX.jpg?format=jpg&name=large\",\"document\":\"Chief Justice of India Ranjan Gogoi, who had appeared unhappy yesterday that a letter requesting help sent by the Unnao rape survivor had not been placed before him, on Thursday signaled the top court’s determination to quickly take a call on the teenager’s SOS.

He assumes the responsibility at a crucial time, with the state witnessing the highest ever number of daily positive Covid19 cases and deaths due to the disease, with no immediate sign of the numbers decreasing. HT lists the top five challenges for the 52-year-old CM and his new cabinet. Covid crisisAs Sarma was the health minister in the previous Sonowal cabinet, and was hands-on in attempts at controlling spread of the disease, setting up Covid care centres, visiting patients at hospitals, procuring life-saving medicines and all required goods, it was expected he would keep the portfolio even after donning the CM’s chair. But he chose to give the responsibility to Keshab Mahanta, working president of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) alliance partner, Asom Gana Parishad.  The move surprised many as despite being a senior minister in the earlier cabinet, Mahanta doesn’t have much experience in handling such a crisis and his role as water resources minister in the previous cabinet wasn’t felt to be up to the mark. Assam is recording around 5,500-6000 new Covid-19 cases and an average of 70 deaths a day due to the disease.  With positivity rate hovering between 8% and 10%, the state has nearly 40,000 active cases — putting immense pressure on the state’s health infrastructure and all those involved in the medical sector. Also Read | Grenade blast in Assam’s Tinsukia leaves one dead, 2 injuredSarma is aware of the situation.  He has already instructed ministers to visit all districts and file a ground report on status of the pandemic within three days.  Stricter restrictions have been put in place, including closing down all office in urban areas and increasing the curfew duration to 15 hours daily.  On Wednesday, he directed officials to conduct around 100,000 tests daily to detect positive cases early. Fixing finances As finance minister in the Sonowal government, Sarma is well aware of the financial realities of the state.  As per government figures the state has liabilities of nearly ₹23,000 cr and total cumulative debt of around ₹85,000 cr.  Like other states, Assam too faced difficulties in achieving its projected growth estimates at least in the first two quarters of last financial year, but the state continued to pay full salaries and pensions to its serving and retired employees. Significantly, the CM didn’t keep this portfolio too with himself and gave the responsibility to Ajanta Neog, a former Congress minister and Sarma’s one-time cabinet colleague who switched sides to the BJP just ahead of the assembly polls and won from the Golaghat seat.  Incidentally, Neog is the state’s first woman finance minister. Addressing his first press conference on Monday after assuming charge, Sarma said that the state has ₹7,000 cr in its treasury and assured that the new government will be able to pursue its welfare and development schemes without facing any hurdles.  “We have one of the best fiscal situations in the country in the entire country.  There’s absolutely no cause of concern on Assam’s finances,” the CM claimed. Besides spending on Covid-19 control, the state government will also have to implement its ambitious promises of providing 100,000 jobs in the first year and waiving of nearly ₹12,000 cr of the microfinance loans taken by women self-help groups.  It will remain to be seen how Sarma and Neog are able to fulfill them and boost the state economy. NRC re-verification Among its ten commitments to voters of Assam ahead of the assembly polls, the BJP promised delivering a corrected National Register of Citizens (NRC) as per the Supreme Court (SC) mandate, in order to protect genuine citizens and detect illegal infiltrators so that Assam’s civilization “remains protected”. In Assam, as per the Assam Accord of 1985, anyone who has been staying in the state prior to March 24, 1971 or can establish lineage to people residing on or before that date is considered as Indian citizen — a requirement also accepted for inclusion in the National Register of Citizens (NRC) updated in 2019.  The names of around 1. 9 million people who failed to prove their or their ancestor’s residency in Assam on that date and those who were declared foreigners by foreigners’ tribunals (as well their relatives) were excluded from the NRC. Also Read | Bengal Guv Dhankhar to visit Assam to meet post-poll violence hit peopleThe BJP has maintained that the updated document is faulty as it has included dubious persons and excluded genuine citizens and needs to be re-verified.  The process has remained stuck as the NRC office is yet to issue rejection slips to those left out, allowing them to file fresh appeals for inclusion. “Our view on NRC is very clear.  We want 20% re-verification of the list in districts bordering Bangladesh and 10% re-verification in other districts.  If after that, the NRC is found to be correct, the state government would accept it and take the process forward.  But if the NRC is found faulty after re-verification, we would want the Supreme Court to view this issue critically,” Sarma said at his first press conference as CM. NRC coordinator Hitesh Dev Sarma has filed an application in SC, seeking a complete, comprehensive and time-bound re-verification of the draft NRC as well as the supplementary list of NRC as some “glaring anomalies of serious nature” were detected in the process.  The application sought re-verification to be done under supervision of a monitoring committee preferably represented by district judge, district magistrate and superintendent of police. ST status to six communities The BJP has also committed to granting scheduled tribe (ST) status to six communities of the state — Koch-Rajbongshi, Tai Ahom, Moran, Motok, Sutiya and tea-tribes, currently falling under other backward castes (OBC) category.  Prime Minister Narendra Modi had promised it ahead of 2014 Lok Sabha polls and it was also part of BJP poll promise in 2016 ahead of the Assam assembly polls. The promise hasn’t been fulfilled yet.  Though the Centre introduced a Bill in Rajya Sabha in January 2019 on granting ST status to these 6 communities, voting didn’t take place on it and the Bill lapsed.  The state’s first BJP-led government of Sarbananda Sonowal also didn’t take much initiative on the issue apart from creating autonomous councils form Morans, Motoks and Koch-Rajbongshis in September last year — ahead of this year’s assembly election. The six communities are estimated to have a total population of nearly 15 million.  While the BJP has been able to keep them pacified with the promise of ST status, by attracting some leaders of these communities to the party-fold and by creating the three new autonomous councils, it will have act fast if it doesn’t want this issue to lead to mass agitations. Also Watch | Assam: 18 elephants killed in lightning strikes in Nagaon district“Our government will try and ensure granting of ST status to these communities through talks with all stakeholders without hurting the interests of other communities who are already in the same category.  Our previous government had worked on some ways in which this issued could be resolved and we are confident on doing that in coming days,” Sarma said in his press conference. Flood-free Assam Floods are an annual scourge that affects millions in Assam every year.  The state witnesses several rounds of floods during the monsoon season, which leads to loss of lives, large scale erosion, thousands getting uprooted from their home and loss of property.  The biggest contributor to this flooding is the Brahmaputra that flows thorough Assam as well as its tributaries. In 2016, the BJP had promised to dredge the Brahmaputra river of excess silt and reduce the problem of flooding.  For this election, it listed Mission Brahmaputra with the aim of making the state flood-free on top of its 10 commitments made to voters. The BJP has promised new and scientific measures to control floods.  They include dredging, management of Brahmaputra’s tributaries, creating big reservoirs to accumulate extra water from the river, using satellite imagery to identify places where major flooding takes place, and drives to evict squatters from the banks of Brahmaputra and its tributaries. From public health to citizenship, from natural disasters to economy, Himanta Biswa Sarma will have to hit the ground running in Assam. \",\"document_ocr\":\"\",\"Category\":\"Insufficient_Text\"},{\"Id\":34859,\"claim_image\":\"http://pbs.twimg.com/media/EyHDofVVgAAWexe.jpg?format=jpg&name=large\",\"claim\":\"Uttarakhand: Fire breaks out at Bairagi Camp in Kumbh Mela area in Haridwar, 10 fire tenders present at the spot. https://t.co/Hv8t1PBoFd\",\"claim_ocr\":\"ANI\\n\",\"document_image\":\"http://pbs.twimg.com/media/ErhZ4jXUcAIj9XP.jpg?format=jpg&name=large\",\"document\":\"The caskets are stacked three high in the Meissen crematorium's somber memorial hall, piled up in empty offices and stored in hallways.  Many are sealed with plastic wrapping, others are labeled “infection risk,” “urgent” or simply “COVID. ”A surge of coronavirus deaths in this corner of eastern Germany has boosted business for crematorium manager Joerg Schaldach and his staff, but nobody is celebrating. “The situation is a little bit tense for us at the moment,” Schaldach said as another undertaker's van pulled up outside. The crematorium would typically have 70 to 100 caskets on site at this time of year, when the flu season takes its toll on the elderly. “It’s normal for more people to die in winter than in summer,\\\" said Schaldach.  \\\"That’s always been the case. ”Now he has 300 bodies waiting to be cremated and each day dozens more are delivered to the modernist building on a hill overlooking Meissen, an ancient town better known for its delicate porcelain and impressive Gothic castle. On Monday, Meissen county once again took the unwanted lead in Germany's Covid-19 tables, with an infection rate three times the national average.  The state of Saxony, where Meissen is located, includes six of the 10 worst-hit counties in Germany. Schaldach says the crematorium is doing its best to keep up with demand, firing up the twin furnaces every 45 minutes and managing 60 cremations a day. “The ashes still end up in the right urn,” he said. But whereas staff would normally try to ensure the deceased look good for relatives to bid their final farewells, infection rules now mean the caskets of Covid victims have to remain shut throughout, making the entire process even harder for those involved. “It’s our business, we’ve seen death many, many times,\\\" said Schaldach.  \\\"The problem we see is that the grieving relatives need our help.  And at the moment, there’s a greater need for words of consolation because they’ve given their deceased loved one to the ambulance and then they never see them again. ”Some have linked Saxony's high infection rate to wider anti-government sentiment in a state where over a quarter voted for the far-right Alternative for Germany party at the last national election.  Its lawmakers have objected to the need to wear masks, limits on people gathering and the closure of stores.  A few have even denied the existence of a pandemic outright. Other commentators have noted the state's large number of elderly and its reliance on nursing home workers from the neighboring Czech Republic, where Covid-19 infections are even higher. Officials in Meissen, including the head of the county administration, the local doctors association and the lawmaker representing the region in parliament, an ally of Chancellor Angela Merkel, all declined to be interviewed about the situation. Saxony’s governor, Michael Kretschmer, acknowledged in a recent interview with daily Freie Presse that he had underestimated the impact of the pandemic in his state and paid too much attention to those calling for businesses and schools to remain open. A video showing Kretschmer talking to anti-lockdown protesters outside his home Sunday ends with him walking away after one person dons a mask made to look like the German Imperial War Flag, a symbol favored by far-right extremists. Schaldach, the crematorium manager, says most people in Saxony accept the rules.  But he, too, has read comments on social media branding reports about bodies piling up at his crematorium as fake news. “Those who believe in conspiracy theories can’t be helped.  We don’t want to debate with them,\\\" he told The Associated Press.  \\\"They have their beliefs and we have our knowledge. ”Down in Meissen, the streets are empty, devoid of the usual tourists or even the bustle of locals. Franziska Schlieter runs a gourmet food store in the historic city center that's among the few allowed to stay open amid the lockdown.  Her store, which has been run by five generations of her family, is being sustained by a trickle of regulars buying lottery cards and gift baskets. “In the Bible, God sent people plagues when they didn’t behave,” said Schlieter, who feels easing the lockdown over Christmas was a mistake.  “Sometimes I have to think of that. ”On the cobblestone square, Matthias Huth tends a lone food truck outside his shuttered restaurant.  He defends those who have questioned the government’s Covid-19 restrictions, but says skepticism shouldn’t justify denial. “Conversations are starting to change,” Huth said as he served up a dish of chopped blood sausage, sauerkraut and mash known locally as ‘Dead Grandma. ’ “Everyone wants it to be over. ”\",\"document_ocr\":\"\",\"Category\":\"Insufficient_Text\"},{\"Id\":34860,\"claim_image\":\"http://pbs.twimg.com/media/ErhezLsUYAUJCux.jpg?format=jpg&name=large\",\"claim\":\"I'd spoken to Goa CM after the accident, PM had spoken to him too.

Presidential contender Eric Swalwell: 'Let Mueller lay it out' in front of CongressFor Rep.  Eric Swalwell, D-Calif. , and many other Democrats, the findings in special counsel Robert Mueller's report are a launching pad for the next round of investigations examining President Donald Trump -- investigations that they say could ultimately lead to impeachment proceedings. \\\"We're certainly having a conversation about how we hold this president accountable,\\\" Swalwell said on ABC News podcast \\\"The Investigation. \\\" \\\"I wouldn't say impeachment is off the table. \\\"Swalwell joins Sens.  Kamala Harris and  Elizabeth Warren, former Obama housing chief Julian Castro and other presidential candidates in calling for Congress to continue investigating the president's actions outlined in Mueller's report. While Warren and Castro have even announced their support for impeachment proceedings, other key Democrats, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, have cautioned against a singularly focused approach. \\\"While our views range from proceeding to investigate the findings of the Mueller report or proceeding directly to impeachment, we all firmly agree that we should proceed down a path of finding the truth,\\\" Pelosi said in a statement on Tuesday.  \\\"It is also important to know that the facts regarding holding the president accountable can be gained outside of impeachment hearings. \\\"Trump said Monday he is \\\"not even a little bit\\\" concerned about the possibility of impeachment. The special counsel did not establish that members of the Trump campaign coordinated with the Russian government's attempts to meddle in the 2016 election, but Swalwell said contact between the campaign and Russia was \\\"certainly concerning. \\\"\\\"The Russians will continue to interfere,\\\" Swalwell said.  \\\"If we don't set some boundaries around what is acceptable conduct for a campaign or a presidency, we could lose our democracy to future interference attacks. \\\"Swalwell, who announced his presidential bid earlier this month, says a full understanding of Mueller's investigation is key to protecting future elections, and that Congress should receive the full report and then determine what information should be released to the public. \\\"That's how we hold anyone accountable that may not have met criminal culpability, but the Constitution still allows us to hold them accountable,\\\" Swalwell said. He echoed Democratic leadership's calls for Mueller to testify before Congress. \\\"Let Mueller lay it out,\\\" Swalwell said.  \\\"Let's hear his voice describe the combat and see where that leaves Republicans and where that leaves the public. \\\"On the matter of obstruction of justice, Swalwell said it's also up to Congress to evaluate the president's actions detailed in the Mueller report and determine what action needs to be taken. \\\"If we do nothing, what does that mean for future presidencies? \\\" Swalwell asked.  \\\"What does that mean for the standard of conduct that we accept in our democracy? \\\"In the wake of the Mueller report's release, Swalwell also has made numerous calls for Attorney General William Barr to resign, accusing him of favoring Trump and misrepresenting the special counsel's findings by stating there was \\\"no evidence\\\" of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia.  In actuality, the report states that while the investigation \\\"identified numerous links between individuals with ties to the Russian government and individuals associated with the Trump campaign, the evidence was not sufficient to support criminal charges. \\\"\\\"I think,\\\" Swalwell added, \\\"he can either be the president's lawyer or America's lawyer. \\\"24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events\",\"document_ocr\":\"ag%3D\\nmen.\\ntaged\\nYuri Gripas/Reuters\\nIT\\n\",\"Category\":\"Insufficient_Text\"},{\"Id\":34862,\"claim_image\":\"http://pbs.twimg.com/media/EsKiWE-VQAArCW3.jpg?format=jpg&name=large\",\"claim\":\"The tenth round of talks between farmer unions and the Centre over the three farm laws begins at Vigyan Bhawan in New Delhi. https://t.co/oqPjGpHgyu https://t.co/XrpvrwWxKy\",\"claim_ocr\":\"ANI\\nTALLICA\\nveLU MAEc\\n\",\"document_image\":\"http://pbs.twimg.com/media/EsKQ7bXUwAAStuB.jpg?format=jpg&name=large\",\"document\":\"The government has to repeal the three farm laws, one of the farmers' unions asserted on Wednesday ahead of the 10th round of talks with the Centre.  \\\"The government has to make legislation on Minimum Support Price and repeal the three farm laws.

Union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar also assured that the government will hear the proposal with an \\\"open mind\\\". Tens of thousands of farmers, mainly from Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh are agitating against three farm laws enacted by the government in September last year.  The central government has projected the laws as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove middlemen and allow farmers to sell anywhere in the country.  However, the protesting farmers have expressed apprehension that the new laws would pave the way for eliminating the safety cushion of Minimum Support Price and do away with the mandis, leaving them at the mercy of big corporates. The Centre has repeatedly asserted that these laws will remain and have offered to make amendments into the law. The contentious farm laws are farmers are the Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020, and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.

We are so much better than this,” Cummings said, adding, “when we are dancing with the angels, the question will be asked: in 2019 what did we do? ”Cummings’ sentiment drew an emotional response from Cohen, who appeared to be holding back tears when the chairman invoked the harm Cohen’s actions has caused his family.

Overall, Cohen seems to have fended off most Republican attacks on him so far by taking a non-combative approach and repeatedly asserting that while he's lied previously, he's telling the truth now. 2:30 p. m.  – Stormy Daniels weighs in: ‘Michael, I’m proud of you’Shortly before the committee took what was expected to about an hour break for lunch, the adult film actress at the heart of president’s hush money payments controversy released a statement during Cohen’s testimony, saying she’s “proud” of Cohen for “finally beginning to tell the truth about what you did. ”Stormy Daniels, whose name has been repeatedly invoked over the course of Wednesday’s hearing for her role as the recipient of a hush money payment, appeared moved by Cohen’s testimony. “I can hear the pain and regret you feel for betraying your family and your country,” she said.  “Thank you for having the courage, at long last, to begin to tell the truth. ”Cohen executed the $130,000 payment to Daniels prior to the 2016 election.  President Trump has denied having an affair with Daniels. 2:10 p. m.  – Cohen describes plans to have Trump visit Russia during campaignMichael Cohen described negotiations he said he conducted with Trump campaign manager Cory Lewandowski “early on in the campaign” to have Trump visit Russia to “take a look” at the Trump Tower in Moscow project. Cohen and Lewandowski discussed the “possibility of which dates that Mr.  Trump would have availability if, in fact, that we were going to go over to Russia to take a look at the project. ”In November, Cohen pleaded guilty to lying to Congress about whether Trump and his company had pursued the Moscow real estate project while Trump was securing the GOP nomination in 2016. Cohen said the visit “never came to fruition because we were never successful in getting … ownership or control over a piece of property. ”1:45 p. m.  – Cohen contradicts Steele dossier, says he has never been to PragueMichael Cohen insisted under oath on Wednesday that he has never been to Prague or the Czech Republic, a central allegation in the dossier former MI-6 agent Christopher Steele compiled as opposition research. The dossier describes an incident in August 2016 in which Cohen allegedly traveled to Prague to meet with Russians.  Buzzfeed News posted the dossier in January 2017. Cohen has denied this claim in the past, including during an interview with ABC News. “I’ve never actually walked the land in Prague,” Cohen told ABC News.  “And last August I was not in Prague. ”1:25 p. m.  – Cohen says Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner’s attorney ‘reviewed’ his letter to Congress, tooAbbe Lowell, the attorney who represents the president's daughter and son-in-law, Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner, also reviewed Michael Cohen’s letter to Congress in 2017 that ultimately became the basis for charges Cohen lied to Congress, Cohen said Wednesday. They were not immediately available for comment. Cohen said earlier that Jay Sekulow, one of President Trump’s lawyers, made changes and additions to Cohen's statement, and mentioned that others may have, too. Late Wednesday afternoon, Sekulow issued a statement saying, “Today’s testimony by Michael Cohen that attorneys for the President edited or changed his statement to Congress to alter the duration of the Trump Tower Moscow negotiations is completely false. \\\"In his opening statement on Wednesday, Cohen said one of “Mr.  Trump’s personal lawyers reviewed and edited my statement to Congress about the timing of the Moscow Tower negotiations before I gave it. ”Cohen pleaded guilty in November to lying to Congress about whether Trump and his company had pursued the Moscow real estate project while Trump was securing the GOP nomination in 2016. 1:20 p. m.  – Cohen says Trump called him to coordinate messaging -- effectively lie -- about whether he knew about hush money paymentsMichael Cohen said during testimony on Wednesday that President Trump sought to coordinate public messaging about hush money payments to Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal in February 2018.  The women claim to have had affairs with Trump that he has denied. Trump instructed Cohen to say “he was not knowledgeable of the reimbursements and he wasn't knowledgeable of my actions,” Cohen said, referring to the hush money payments. Trump publicly denied knowledge of the payments before his attorney, Rudy Giuliani, confirmed later – in May 2018 – that Trump reimbursed Cohen for the $130,000 payment to Daniels. 1:00 p. m.  – Cohen says Trump lawyer Jay Sekulow made changes to his false statement to CongressMichael Cohen said one of President Trump’s lawyers, Jay Sekulow, made changes and additions to Cohen's statement to Congress in 2017 that ultimately became the basis for charges Cohen lied to Congress. In his opening statement on Wednesday, Cohen said one of “Mr.  Trump’s personal lawyers reviewed and edited my statement to Congress about the timing of the Moscow Tower negotiations before I gave it. ”He later identified that lawyer as Sekulow, who he said made “several changes … including how we were going to handle that message which was … the message, of course, being the length of time that the Trump Tower Moscow project stayed and remained alive. ”Sekulow has not addressed Cohen's claim. Cohen pleaded guilty in November to lying to Congress about whether Trump and his company had pursued the Moscow real estate project while Trump was securing the GOP nomination in 2016. 12:40 p. m.  – Cohen: Aware of another 'illegal act' Trump has committed, says SDNY investigatingMichael Cohen teased another “wrongdoing or illegal act” he claimed President Trump has committed, but said he could not give details because of an ongoing investigation headed by federal prosecutors in the Southern District of New York. Asked by Rep.  Raja Krishnamoorthi, D-Ill. , whether there is “any other wrongdoing or illegal act that you are aware of regarding Donald Trump that we haven't yet discussed today,” Cohen replied he was aware. “Yes,” he said, “and again, those are part of the investigation that's currently being looked at by the Southern District of New York. ”Cohen added that he is in “constant contact with the Southern District of New York regarding ongoing investigations. ”Outside the hearing room, SDNY had no comment. 12:30 p. m.  – Cohen to GOP: ‘Not one question so far has been about Mr.  Trump’In response to questions from Rep.  Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, Cohen called out Republicans on the panel for asking only about him and not President Trump. “I just find it interesting, sir, that between yourself and your colleagues, not one question so far since I'm here has been asked about President Trump,” Cohen said.  “That's actually why I thought I was coming today – not to confess the mistakes that I've made.  I've already done that. “The American people don't care about my taxes,” Cohen said.  “They want to know what it is that I know about Mr.  Trump, and not one question so far has been asked about Mr.  Trump. \\\"12:10 p. m.  – Cohen describes 'several factors' that led him to turn on TrumpAsked what caused him to turn on his longtime boss and effectively testify against him, Michael Cohen dramatically ticked off a list of Trump's actions and statements that led him to speak out. “Helsinki, Charlottesville, watching the daily destruction of our civility to one another, putting up with silly things like this,” Cohen said.  “It’s really unbecoming of Congress. ”Cohen said he used to protect Trump the way Republican members of the House Oversight Committee are protecting the president at Wednesday’s hearing. “I'm responsible for your silliness because I did the same thing that you're doing now for ten years,” Cohen said.  “I protected Mr.  Trump for ten years … I can only warn people the more people that follow Mr.  Trump, as I did blindly, are going to suffer the same consequences that I'm suffering. ”12:02 p. m.  – Cohen rejects accusation he’s trying to get a reduction in sentenceMichael Cohen denied a claim that his appearance is part of an effort to earn a reduction in his prison sentence. Asked by Rep.  Paul Gosar, R-Ariz. , whether his testimony could result in a reduction in his three-year sentence, Cohen said “it’s a possibility,” but rejected the notion that it is his purpose for testifying publicly before the House Oversight Committee. “I'm not sure how my appearance here today is providing substantial information that the Southern District can use for the creation of a case,” Cohen said, before joking, “Now if there is something that this group can do for me, I would gladly welcome it. ”Cohen is scheduled to report to prison on May 6. 12:00 p. m.  – Cohen describes Trump’s involvement in Trump Tower Moscow projectShortly before Michael Cohen asked for a break, he described what he said was the extent of Trump’s involvement in the Trump Tower Moscow negotiations during the campaign. “After each communication that I had [about the Trump Tower Moscow project], I would report back to [Trump] and our goal was to get this project,” Cohen said.  “We were interested in building what would have been the largest building in all of Europe. ”In his opening statement, Cohen said Trump remained directly involved in negotiations and often asked Cohen, “How’s it going in Russia? ”In November, Cohen pleaded guilty to lying to Congress about whether Trump and his company had pursued a Moscow real estate project while he was securing the GOP nomination in 2016. 11:45 a. m.  – Cohen pressed on his claim Trump is 'a racist'Rep.  Mark Meadows, R-N. C. , invited a guest to appear during his questioning of Cohen. Lynne Patton, a current Department of Housing and Urban Development official and former longtime Trump Organization employee, stood behind Meadows as he questioned Cohen about his allegation that Trump is “a racist. ”Meadows put a statement from Patton defending Trump into the record and asked Cohen to reconcile his claim with her defense of Trump as an African-American woman and the daughter of a man who grew up in Birmingham, Alabama. Cohen shot back by pointing out that he stands by his testimony as the son of a Holocaust survivor, prompting audible \\\"oohs\\\" from onlookers inside the hearing room. 11:30 a. m.  – Cohen hits back: 'Shame on you, Mr.  Jordan'Cohen, who once called himself Donald Trump’s “attack dog,” unleashed a heated rebuke of the ranking Republican on the committee, Rep.  Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, during a debate over whether Cohen accepted his guilt. Jordan read a quote the December indictment of Cohen written by federal prosecutors in the Southern District of New York.  It said Cohen’s “consciousness of wrongdoing is fleeting, his instinct to blame others is strong,” and accused Cohen of failing to appropriately show remorse for his actions. Cohen took issue with that characterization. “Shame on you, Mr.  Jordan,” Cohen said.  “That's not what I said.  What I said is, I took responsibility and I take responsibility … I am remorseful and I am going to prison. \\\"Cohen is scheduled to report to prison on May 6 to serve a three-year sentence. 11:12 a. m.  – Cohen says Trump and his children were ‘compromised’ by RussiaDuring a line of questioning about WikiLeaks’ release of internal Democrat National Committee and Hillary Clinton campaign emails, Cohen said he believes President Trump and his children may have been “conflicted or compromised” by Russia during the 2016 presidential campaign. He stopped short of characterizing the campaign’s alleged knowledge of the impending release of hacked Democrats’ emails as “collusion,” but said there was “something odd. ”\\\"As I stated in my testimony, I wouldn't use the word colluding,\\\" Cohen said.  Was there something odd about the back and forth praise with President Putin?  Yes.  But I'm not really sure that I can answer that question in terms of collusion. \\\"In his opening statement, Cohen claimed that Trump, as a candidate, knew his longtime political confidant Roger Stone was talking with Julian Assange about WikiLeaks' revealing of emails from prominent Democrats. 11:05 a. m.  – Cohen denies any desire to work in the White HouseRep.  Jim Jordan of Ohio, the ranking Republican on the committee and first to question Cohen, accused Cohen of acting in defiance of President Trump because he was upset at not getting a position in the White House after Trump’s election. Cohen categorically denied the allegation. “Mr.  Jordan, all I wanted was what I got, to be personal attorney to the president,” Cohen said. Cohen described an incident in which Trump \\\"reamed out\\\" former White House chief of staff Reince Priebus because Cohen hadn't gotten a job in the White House Counsel's office. 10:55 a. m.  – Questioning begins with an inquiry into hush money paymentsAfter Cohen’s 30-minute opening statement, the questioning portion of Wednesday’s hearing is underway. Rep.  Cummings, as committee chairman, began with a line of questioning about the hush money payments Cohen made to adult film actress Stormy Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, and his reimbursement by Trump. “The president said he knew nothing of these favors,” Cummings said.  “Based on your conversations with him, is there any doubt in your mind that President Trump knew exactly what he was paying for? ”“There is no doubt in my mind and I truly believe there is no doubt in the people of the United States of America,” Cohen said. Cohen presented a copy of a check Trump allegedly wrote, after taking office, to reimburse Cohen for the hush-money payment. Outside the hearing room, the Trump Organization responded that Donald Trump Jr.  had \\\"no concept/idea\\\" that he was signing a check to reimburse Cohen for the Stormy Daniels hush money payment.  Donald Trump Jr.  signed the $35,000 check as a trustee of the Donald J.  Trump Revocable Trust. President Trump has denied having an affair with Daniels. 10:42 a. m.  – Michael Cohen shares regrets, shame for a decade of work for Trump“And yet I continued working for him. ”That’s the refrain Michael Cohen is repeating after each damning anecdote he offers about President Trump.  Cohen’s opening statement included repeated mentions of how \\\"ashamed\\\" he feels now about his work for Trump. “I am ashamed because I know what Mr.  Trump is,” Cohen said. Cohen described with remorse the threatening letters he wrote on Trump’s behalf and the bidding he did for a man he called “a racist,” “a conman,” and “a cheat. ”“I am not a perfect man,” Cohen said.  “I have done things I am not proud of, and I will live with the consequences of my actions for the rest of my life. ”10:30 a. m.  – Cohen paints damning picture of Trump in opening statementMichael Cohen tore into President Trump’s character and business acumen in a scathing opening statement, calling him \\\"a racist,\\\" \\\"a con man\\\" and \\\"a cheat. \\\"ABC News reported details of Cohen’s intended testimony earlier on Wednesday. Cohen divulged that Trump, as a candidate, knew Roger Stone was talking with Julian Assange about WikiLeaks' revealing of emails from the Democratic National Committee. 10:25 a. m.  – Cohen sworn in, gives opening statementMichael Cohen began his opening statement after rising, raising his right hand, and being sworn in. \\\"Chairman Cummings, Ranking Member Jordan, and Members of the Committee, thank you for inviting me here today,” Cohen said.  “I am here under oath to correct the record, to answer the Committee’s questions truthfully, and to offer the American people what I know about President Trump. ”10:18 a. m.  – Ranking Republican slams Cohen, Democrats in opening statementThe ranking Republican on the Oversight Committee launched an early attack on Michael Cohen’s credibility and Democrats’ willingness to hear the former fixer’s testimony on Wednesday. “The first announced witness for the 116th Congress is a guy who is going to prison in two months for lying to Congress,” Rep.  Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, said in his opening comments. Jordan criticized Cummings for offering “a convicted felon a forum to tell stories and lie about the president of the United States so they can all start their impeachment process. ”“They just want to use you, Mr.  Cohen,” Jordan said.  “You're their patsy today. ”10:12 a. m.  – Chairman Rep.  Cummings warns Cohen not to lieIn his opening statement, the committee’s chairman, Rep.  Elijah Cummings, warned Cohen against lying to his panel. “I have made it abundantly clear to Mr.  Cohen that if he comes here today and he does not tell us the truth, I will be the first one to refer those untruthful statements to DOJ (the Department of Justice),” Cummings said. Cohen pleaded guilty to lying to Congress in December – charges brought by special counsel Robert Mueller. Cummings added that its hearing today and moving forward reflect a new era of Democratic oversight. “The days of this committee protecting the president at all costs are over,” he said. 10:07 a. m.  – Republicans move to postpone Cohen’s hearingA top Republican leveled an early effort to stop Cohen’s testimony, demanding the hearing be delayed. Rep.  Mark Meadows, R-N. C. , raised a procedural tactic to delay the hearing, citing the short notice of the committee’s receipt of Cohen’s testimony and evidence he plans to present. The committee voted down Rep.  Meadows’ point of order and the hearing continued. 10 a. m.  Cohen takes witness chair, hearing beginsMichael Cohen entered the committee at 10 a. m on the dot and took the witness chair for what promised to be dramatic testimony about his former boss Donald Trump before the House Oversight Committee.  The panel's chairman, Rep.  Elijah Cummings, D-Md. , gaveled in the hearing shortly thereafter. The man who once said he would take a bullet for Donald Trump is poised to excoriate his longtime former boss with more than a decade of anecdotes. In his opening statement, Cohen is expected to characterize Trump as a “racist” and a “conman. ”9:55 a. m.  Committee members gathering inside hearing roomMembers of the House Oversight Committee are gathering in the committee’s hearing room with just minutes until Michael Cohen is expected to take his seat. Democrats met this morning in committee chambers before congregating in the hearing room.  Republicans on the panel have set up large posters with Cohen’s past comments flattering the president. Cohen had no comment as he arrived on Capitol Hill.  As he left his hotel Wednesday morning, staff and hotel guests greeted and wished him well, some hugging him and people saying “God bless you. ”“I’m going to do the right thing,” Cohen said.  He also called it “the craziest day” of his life. Cohen, who spent a decade at Trump's side at the Trump Organization, will testify before House lawmakers at 10 a. m.  Wednesday as President Trump wraps up his first day of meetings with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Vietnam. Cohen is scheduled to begin a three-year prison sentence in May and has pleaded guilty to lying to Congress as well as financial crimes including bank and tax fraud.  Cohen also pleaded guilty to campaign finance violation for payments made to adult film star Stormy Daniels during the 2016 presidential campaign. The White House, along with Republicans on Capitol Hill, sought to discredit Cohen ahead of his appearance. \\\"Disgraced felon Michael Cohen is going to prison for lying to Congress and making other false statements,\\\" White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said Tuesday in a statement.  \\\"Sadly, he will go before Congress this week and we can expect more of the same.  It's laughable that anyone would take a convicted liar like Cohen at his word, and pathetic to see him given yet another opportunity to spread his lies. \\\"Rep.  Matt Gaetz, R-Fla. , a staunch Trump ally, also tweeted Tuesday that the hearing could reveal alleged details about Cohen's romantic life, prompting outrage from Democrats and ethics experts. The stakes were also high for Democrats in the House, who have vowed to investigate the president and conduct oversight of the administration amid accusations of overreach from Republicans. House Oversight Committee Chairman Elijah Cummings, D-Md. , suggested the hearing \\\"may very well be a turning point in our country's history. \\\"\\\"He's the only person that I know of who has accused this president of a crime,\\\" he told reporters on Monday. Cohen was prepared to provide lawmakers with documents to support his claims that Trump allegedly inflated and deflated his net worth for personal and professional gain, and to avoid paying property taxes, according to a source familiar with his intended testimony. The president's former fixer was also expected to explain why he lied to Congress in 2017 about discussions he had during the presidential campaign about the proposed Trump Tower Moscow. His specific allegation of criminal wrongdoing relates to Trump's reimbursement to Cohen for the payment to adult film actress and director Stormy Daniels, who alleged an affair with Trump, according to the source familiar with Cohen's planned testimony. Trump has denied the affair alleged by Daniels and another accusation from former Playboy model Karen McDougal and has previously said the payment amounted to nothing more than a \\\"simple private transaction,\\\" and that they do not qualify as campaign finance violations. Cohen appeared before the House Oversight and Reform Committee after postponing an initial hearing date, citing \\\"threats\\\" to his family by Trump and his lawyer Rudy Giuliani. On Tuesday he spent hours behind closed doors with the Senate Intelligence Committee and will meet with the House Intelligence Committee in private on Thursday. \\\"Two years ago when this investigation started, I said it may be the most important thing I'm involved in my public life in the Senate,\\\" Sen.  Mark Warner, D-Va. , the top Democrat on the panel, told reporters after the panel questioned Cohen.  \\\"Nothing I have heard today dissuades me from that view. \\\"\\\"We will call out the Democrats' charade for what it is -- a partisan circus meant to destroy President Trump,\\\" Reps.  Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, and Mark Meadows, R-N. C. , said in a USA Today editorial. At Cohen's sentencing hearing in December, special counsel Robert Mueller's team said Cohen had cooperated with their investigation. Ahead of the House hearing, during his day with the Senate Intelligence Committee, Cohen was officially disbarred as a lawyer in New York, according to a decision from the Appellate Division of the New York State Supreme Court expected after his November guilty plea.

End of a marathon.  Take a bow, Pujara! Lyon continues to wheel awayPant has looked more in control in this innings.  However, Nathan Lyon has consistently bowled in the right areas asking questions.  So far, it has been a restrained approach by the young wicket-keeper batsman.

Tough chance, but a chance indeed400 for IndiaRishabh Pant goes for a big one and the ball drops just ahead of Pat Cummins in long-on.

The Pujara ShowIn Tests since 2000, only three players have scored more runs than Cheteshwar Pujara, at a higher average, and with a higher dismissal rate: Jacques Kallis, Rahul Dravid, and Shivnarine Chanderpaul.  #AUSvINDPant on songRishabh Pant has started the innings on a positive note with few good shots and he is probably the best partner Pujara could have asked for right now.  Pant’s shot play has taken the pressure away from the more experienced batsman and he can concentrate on playing his natural game.  India 363/5No Reviews LeftAustralia have used up their second review as Tim Paine was convinced that Rishabh Pant has nicked one back to his gloves.

Little rough developing outside the left hander's off stump at the pavilion end.  Not worrisome yet but if India keep Australia's bowlers in the field longer, Jadeja will begin to get very interestedStart of playCheteshwar Pujara and Hanuma Vihari are out in the middle for India while Josh Hazlewood will be bowling the first over of the day for Australia.  India are well placed in this game and they will be looking to post a big total. Agarwal on PujaraPujara was unbeaten on 130 runs at stumps, having faced 250 balls, the fourth time he has played 200-plus deliveries in an innings on this tour.  Agarwal talked about learning from his batting style and showered heady praise on the senior batsman who scored his third hundred of the series on Thursday. “Definitely, it is great to watch him bat from the other end and also to watch him bat the way he grinds the bowlers.  He has got a pattern to it and he understands his strengths and know that he is very tight with his defence.  He looks to do that and waits for the bad ball to come. “This game is for five days and there is time.  It is a very long game and if you see him bat, you can learn a lot.  Patience is his strength and he sticks to that,” he said. Phenomenal PujaraMost runs on Day 1 of a Test by an Indian in Australia:195 V Sehwag, MCG, 2003144 M Vijay, Gabba, 2014132 S Gavaskar, SCG, 1986130 C Pujara, SCG, 2019 *124 S Tendulkar, Adelaide, 2008123 C Pujara, Adelaide, 2018India’s RecordIndia have never lost a test match when Kohli has won the toss -- winning 18 and drawing three -- but more importantly the tourists had the opportunity to bat the Australians out of the game as they did in Melbourne. Australia BowlersFor Australia, Hazelwood emerged as the highest wickets taker on the day with two wickets in his kitty while Starc and Lyon contributed with one wicket each on Day One of the match. Agarwal Disappointed“I am quite disappointed for missing out on a big score.  With that said, it’s a learning curve.  If I don’t make this mistake again, it will be a good learning.  I was looking to dominate Nathan Lyon and it didn’t work out.  Really disappointed that I threw my wicket,” Mayank Agarwal said on Thursday. India eye historyThe visitors lead the series 2-1 after winning the opening clash in Adelaide and the third one in Melbourne.  Australia claimed victory in Perth.  If India, the world’s top-ranked nation, win or draw in Sydney they will clinch a first-ever series in Australia since they began touring Down Under in 1947-48. Kohli booed in SydneyFormer Australian captain Ricky Ponting has slammed sections of the SCG crowd for booing India skipper Virat Kohli when he walked out to bat on the opening day of the fourth Test here Thursday.  Kohli was given a mixed reception when he came to bat after the fall of opener Mayank Agarwal with the Indians fans chanting his name, while some of Australia’s fans booing the star batsman.  “If it was booing then it’s absolutely disgraceful,” Ponting said on Channel 7. Pujara reigns supremeAt stumps, Pujara (130) and Hanuma Vihari (39) were holding fort for the visiting side, which is in pursuit of a maiden Test series triumph on Australian soil.  Virat Kohli’s men have already secured the Border-Gavaskar Trophy with their unassailable lead. Hello and welcomeWelcome to the live coverage of Day 2 of the fourth Test match between India and Australia.  Day 1 belonged completely to India as Cheteshwar Pujara contributed an unbeaten 130 to India’s 303 for four.  The hosts, facing a desperate scrap to avoid being the first Australia team to lose a series to India on home soil, managed to dislodge Mayank Agarwal after a bright 77, Virat Kohli for 23 and Ajinkya Rahane for 18.  But Pujara took his series tally to 458 and add another century to those that helped India to wins in Adelaide and Melbourne. \",\"document_ocr\":\"Super Dom\\n\",\"Category\":\"Insufficient_Text\"},{\"Id\":34866,\"claim_image\":\"http://pbs.twimg.com/amplify_video_thumb/1398016978175074311/img/2f6PEw7-LU86dd5Q.jpg?format=jpg&name=large\",\"claim\":\"\\\"He somehow knew I was there.\\\"\\n\\n“Alex was really fighting hard.

Three newly-elected BJP lawmakers from north Bengal, Sankhar Ghosh from Siliguri, Sikha Chatterjee from Dabgram-Fulbari and Anandamoy Burman from Matigara-Naxalbari, were detained by the police when they started a sit-in demonstration at Hafdar Hashmi Chowk in Siliguri demanding better handling of healthcare facilities in the wake of a sharp spike in Coronavirus infections in the region.  “The three legislators were detained because there is a ban on political assembly.  They were released later,” an officer from Siliguri police station said on condition of anonymity.  Former Trinamool Congress (TMC) minister Gautam Deb, who has been made administrator of the Siliguri Municipal Corporation following his defeat at Dabgram-Fulbari, said, “The BJP MLAs acted irresponsibly only to be in the news. ” Police detained several people in other parts of Bengal for violating lockdown restrictions.

Of the 122 candidates it has declared so far, four are sitting members of Parliament, though Swapan Dasgupta has resigned from his Rajya Sabha membership after his candidature was found to be in violation of norms for nominated members in the Upper house.  The party has also not declared any chief ministerial candidate in the elections, even though Mamata Banerjee’s personal popularity is supposed to be the Trinamool Congress’s (TMC) biggest trump card in these elections.  Many commentators have pointed out that it suggests a dearth of candidates in the BJP. That doesn’t fit with reports of large-scale protests at the BJP’s office in Kolkata and elsewhere by party workers who are dissatisfied with the candidate selection.  This underlines an intense inner-party competition for securing nominations in the forthcoming polls. So what explains this seeming contradiction? This is best understood by deploying the concept of “party-society”, an idea developed by Dwaipayan Bhattacharyya, among the most eminent social scientists to have worked on the state’s politics, and currently a professor of political science at Jawaharlal Nehru University. Also Read | In West Bengal, battle for Matua vote heats upA brief recap of the BJP’s rise in West Bengal and the existing state of play in the state’s politics is useful before getting into Bhattacharyya’s idea and its relevance to the question at hand. Usurping the CPI(M) vote bank will not be enough for the BJPThe BJP first made its impact in the state in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, when its vote share jumped to 17% and it won two Lok Sabha seats.  The BJP’s rise came at the cost of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) or CPI(M) led Left Front, which suffered an almost equal erosion in its vote share.  This trend gained further momentum in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, when the TMC suffered a huge fall in seat share—its tally went down from 34 to 22 between 2014 and 2019—despite the party increasing its vote share by around three percentage points.  The CPI(M) led Left Front suffered a collapse of sorts in these elections with a vote share of less than 10%, the BJP again gaining most of it. While the BJP’s gains were impressive, even a repeat of the 2019 performance will not be enough to bring it to power in the state.  An assembly constituency (AC) wise disaggregation of 2019 results would give the TMC and BJP 164 and 121 seats respectively.  The halfway mark in West Bengal assembly is 148. Winning 18 Lok Sabha seats is one thing; forming a state government, entirely another.  Here’s why. West Bengal has the second largest share of Muslims—the 2011 census puts it at 27%—in any state in India, after Assam.  This basically means that the BJP must win around two-thirds of the non-Muslim voters to try and reach a 45% vote share in what has become an almost entirely bipolar contest to get past the halfway mark. Also Read | Barak Valley: Cong’s anti-CAA stance may hurt it; BJP’s worry is Assam AccordThis is a very different sort of a challenge compared to a state such as Assam, which has the largest share of Muslims—34% according to the 2011 census—in India.  The BJP formed a government in Assam with less than 30% of vote share, because it was in alliance with other regional parties.  There are no such allies for the BJP in West Bengal.  Having usurped most of the CPI(M)’s base—at least a significant part of what is left with the CPI(M) is its ideological cadre that would be ideologically averse to voting for a Hindutva driven party—the only logical option for the BJP is to target the TMC’s non-Muslim vote bank. TMC defections to the BJP: a bitter pill which must be swallowed The BJP realised this much before the 2021 elections.  While Mukul Roy, once considered Mamata Banerjee’s trusted lieutenant in the TMC switched sides in 2017 itself, Prime Minister Narendra Modi gave a hint of what was to come when he claimed during the 2019 campaign that at least 40 TMC MLAs were in touch with the BJP and would quit the TMC after declaration of results. Even in 2019, the BJP successfully fielded TMC turncoats such as Arjun Singh, a four-time TMC MLA, from Barrackpore.  After the BJP won 18 Lok Sabha seats in the 2019 polls, the floodgates seem to have opened as far as exodus of TMC leaders to the BJP is concerned.  The most prized post-2019 defector has been Suvendu Adhikari.  His defection has forced Mamata Banerjee to shift her assembly constituency and face Adhikari in Nandigram to preserve the aura of TMC’s invincibility in the strategically important South Bengal region. While these defections are important in bringing popular faces and politically necessary muscle to the BJP on the ground, they also cause some collateral damage.  An important reason for defection of CPI(M) supporters to the BJP was the former’s inability to take on the TMC cadre’s strong-arm tactics. Also Read | Full coverage of assembly elections 2021This was best seen in the 2018 Panchayat polls in the state, which saw the highest share of seats being decided without any contests (in favour of the ruling party).  This basically means opponents were not even allowed to file nominations.  While this is not a unique thing in West Bengal politics, the scale was unprecedented.  This figure was 34% for gram panchayats in 2018, more than three times the previous record of 11% under the CPI(M) in 2003.  In some districts, the share of uncontested seats was at least 50%.  A 2018 HT article by political scientist Neelanjan Sircar discussed this issue in detail.  With some of the TMC leaders who helped achieve this now joining the BJP, those who were already part of the latter, or moved to it from the CPI(M) are not just likely to feel disappointed but also upset at their one-time oppressors joining the same camp. Anecdotal accounts confirm that giving tickets to TMC turncoats is a major factor behind BJP workers protesting against the party’s ticket distribution. But winning West Bengal is crucial for preserving the BJP’s dominant party imageWhy is the BJP doing what it is doing?  West Bengal is perhaps the most important state election the BJP will face before the 2024 Lok Sabha elections.  In some ways, the political importance of 2021 West Bengal contest can be compared to the 2017 Uttar Pradesh contest, where the BJP’s victory gave it a huge boost. The BJP, under its current leadership, is not averse to taking positions which contradict its larger politics in order to win elections or secure power.  The party’s failed coalition with the People’s Democratic Party in the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir is one example.  The BJP wants complete electoral dominance and it wants it now.  It is this urgent hunger for power which has necessitated the BJP’s engagement with West Bengal’s “party-society”. party-society: West Bengal’s contribution to the political science lexicon The CPI(M)-led Left Front ruled West Bengal for an uninterrupted 34 years from 1977 to 2011.  This is a record in democratic politics not just in India but across the world.  What explains the CPI(M)’s ability to win elections for so long? As is to be expected, opinions are polarised on this issue.  While the CPI(M) and its sympathisers claim that it was the Left’s pro-poor policies, especially land reforms, which ensured its victories, its opponents allege large-scale intimidation and electoral malpractices behind the dominance.  None of these maximalist positions can tell us the truth.  If the CPI(M) had a solid support from the peasantry, why did it risk land acquisition which ultimately cost it its biggest support base in the country?  And if it was indeed rigging which earned the CPI(M) its victories, why could it not win the 2008 Panchayat and 2009 Lok Saha elections, even though it was ruling the state? Among the most cogent explanations of this issue has been given by Dwaipayan Bhattacharyya, who has evolved the concept of something called a party-society in response to the concept of Political Society, which was developed by Partha Chatterjee, a political scientist based at Columbia University and the Centre for Study of Social Sciences in Kolkata. A 2009 Economic and Political Weekly paper called Of Control and Factions: The Changing ‘Party-Society’ in Rural West Bengal by Bhattacharyya discusses these issues.  Chatterjee describes a Political Society as “made of poor and marginal population groups which, in absence of citizen’s rights, protect their livelihood demand along the lines of communities (not primordial but strategic solidarities in response to concrete governmental policies) as they negotiate with the state and civil society”.  A group of slum dwellers who have encroached upon government land and use politics to negotiate their interests is a good example of this.  Chatterjee attributed the CPI(M)’s success to its “day-to-day management of political society with the help of a well-orchestrated, locally embedded and vertically connected party-machinery”. Bhattacharya describes his idea of party-society as “a specific form of Political Society in West Bengal’s country-side” which he says was made possible by “popular acceptance of political parties as moral guardians not only in the public life of the society but also in the private lives of the families”.  To simplify academic jargon, in a party-society, one can expect a political party to intervene not just in issues in the society, say something like the construction of a school, but even in intra-family disputes such as marital discord or a property dispute among siblings. While this makes a party-society more pervasive than a political society, Bhattacharyya also underlines an important difference between the two.  In the former, “the over-riding goal is to protect the constituency of a party’s support-base and expand it periodically from election to election”, he says.  Because even Panchayat elections in West Bengal are held under party-affiliation, “party-society in rural West Bengal operating mainly through Panchayat elections runs the risk of being repetitive and predictable, if not explicitly bureaucratic”, he writes. The TMC did not dismantle the party-society CPI(M) built, it merely usurped it Bhattacharyya’s paper, which was written before the 2009 Lok Sabha elections, is a prescient account of the CPI(M)’s eventual fate.  In one of the villages where he did field work, the CPI(M)’s local leadership, which included its Panchayat functionaries had to adjudicate issues catering to various vested interests such as sale of land which was supposed to be under the possession of tenants, and where the pursuant wanted to build residential properties but the party, read the CPI(M), wanted a factory built.  The final decision by the party was not made on merits of the case but depended on factional balance of power within the higher party organisation. As is to be expected, such activities are bound to create a set of gainers and losers, and it is entirely likely that the latter would constitute the majority of voters.  It is this pent-up discontent against the CPI(M) cadre which was exploited by the TMC to perpetrate large scale violence against the left’s grassroots leadership in large parts of the state after 2011.  In many of these instances, the TMC leadership forced the opposition cadre to switch sides in return for “physical safety”, a tactic which was borrowed from the left’s playbook but magnified manifold. Once in power, the TMC found it useful to usurp the party-society model rather than dismantle it.  If anything, the TMC’s party-society is a cruder version of what existed during the CPI(M), because unlike the latter, there is no coherent ideological core to the TMC’s politics. The unprecedented level of intimidation in the 2018 Panchayat elections, which were held in the backdrop of a surprise BJP victory in CPI(M) ruled Tripura, which also has a significant Bengali population, was a clear attempt by the TMC to tighten the party-society’s hold in West Bengal’s rural political landscape. 2021 is the BJP’s tryst with party-society The BJP realises that unless the TMC’s hold over party-society is broken, it will be difficult to capture political power in the state.  It is this realisation which has forced it to woo TMC leaders and cadre to join the party. However, there are two reasons why the BJP’s attempts to usurp West Bengal’s party-society will be even more chaotic than the TMC’s. The CPI(M) controlled the party-society beast through a highly disciplined organisation, which worked on Stalinist lines and where questioning the party leadership meant expulsion.  What the TMC lacked in organisational discipline, it compensated for in Mamata Banerjee’s personal charisma, which is what has been driving the party’s electoral fortunes.  The BJP has neither at the moment.  While it has a committed cadre drawn from the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), this is not enough to catapult the party to power in the state.  The lack of a clear leader in the state also means that it is easier to rebel against the leadership’s decisions on questions such as ticket distribution without antagonising the central leadership.  The blame can be conveniently put on the state-level leadership.  Such disputes will only increase when it comes to elections for local bodies. Because the BJP’s political modus operandi involves not giving tickets to Muslims, who have a sizeable presence in the state, non-Muslims would have bigger expectations of getting a nomination in the BJP than any other party.  Think of a Muslim majority AC which would have not had any Hindu leader hopeful of securing a nomination.  The BJP does not have this luxury.  The BJP’s model of building a rainbow Hindu coalition in the name of Sabka Saath, Sabka Vishwas —(support of all, trust of all)—is also a recipe for Sabka Saath, Sabka Vivaad—(support of all, dispute among all. )This does not rule out the BJP’s chances in West Bengal None of what has been discussed should be inferred to conclude that the BJP does not stand a chance in West Bengal in the short-term or medium-term.  The BJP was just about three percentage points behind the TMC in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls.  West Bengal will be a closely contested election.  What can be said is that West Bengal is bound to undergo a deep political churning, which will last beyond the forthcoming elections. The BJP’s current dominance in Indian politics has triggered its own set of socio-political processes.  Political scientists Sudha Pai and Sajjan Kumar offer an insightful analysis of this process and described it as “Everyday Communalism” in their 2018 book published by the Oxford University Press called Everyday Communalism: Riots in Contemporary Uttar Pradesh.  The authors argue that the ability to convert even day to day disputes, some of them really petty, into communal conflicts is crucial the BJP’s political success in the state.  It will not be an understatement to say that the BJP is trying to deploy this tactic in the West Bengal contest as well, as was described by Kumar in an HT article explaining the salience of the BJP’s Jai Shri Ram push in West Bengal. The BJP clearly hopes to co-opt parts of what constitutes the TMC-dominated party-society today and eventually reshape West Bengal’s polity on the lines where political polarisation is driven by questions of Everyday Communalism.  Irrespective of what the results are on May 2, this ambition is bound to generate a lot of churn and disruption in West Bengal in not just the short but also medium-term. \",\"document_ocr\":\"ANI\\n\",\"Category\":\"Insufficient_Text\"},{\"Id\":34871,\"claim_image\":\"http://pbs.twimg.com/media/EAQZ7XIWkAArNwT.jpg?format=jpg&name=large\",\"claim\":\"Live Now: Robert Mueller testifies in his second hearing today on Capitol Hill.\\n\\nWatch on CNN: https://t.co/UYpqI3w42L\\n\\nFollow rolling updates: https://t.co/B5ATNi0ODY https://t.co/DVU8H7hL0J\",\"claim_ocr\":\"Capitol Hill\\n1:07 PM ET\\nUS House of\\nPERMANE\\nINT\\nMMITTEE ON\\nGENCE\\nER SPECIAL COU\\nROBERT S.

Mueller contradicts Trump, says report did not exonerate himFormer special counsel Robert Mueller answered questions for the first time for more than six hours on Wednesday during historic testimony on Capitol Hill in back-to-back House hearings into his probe into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and possible obstruction of justice by President Donald Trump. Key moments included Mueller saying his report did not exonerate the president as Trump has claimed and contending he could be charged after leaving office. But he also did not answer many questions, frustrating both Republicans, who tried to discredit his probe, and Democrats who pressed him on whether he had left it to Congress whether to pursue impeachment, believing that Justice Department policy prevented him from indicting a sitting president. Democrats on the House Judiciary and Intelligence committees labored for months to bring the 74-year-old Mueller before Congress to answer lingering questions about his 22-month investigation. Mueller was reluctant to appear before Congress, and only agreed to appear under subpoena from both panels.  \\\"The report is my testimony,\\\" he said in his only public statement on the report in May. Here is how the day developed:3:25 p. m.  'Had it been anyone else in the country they would have been indicted,' Chairman Schiff said as hearing endedAfter more than six hours of facing questions, Robert Mueller spent his last few minutes of his historic testimony listening to bluntly-worded final comments from Rep.  Adam Schiff,\\\"The facts you set out in your report and have spoken about today, tell a disturbing tale of a massive Russian interference in our election, of a campaign so eager to win, so driven by greed, it was willing to accept the help of a hostile power in a presidential election decided by a handful of votes in a few key states,\\\" Schiff said. \\\"They risked going to jail by lying to you, to the FBI and to congress about it and indeed some have gone to jail over such lies.  And your work speaks of a president who committed many acts of obstruction of justice.  Had it been anyone else in the country they would have been indicted,\\\" Schiff said. Schiff then excused Mueller and the former special counsel left the room quietly without making further comment. 3:14 p. m.  Mueller is asked about Trump's tax returns\\\"Your office did not obtain the president's tax returns which could otherwise show foreign financial services, correct? \\\" Rep.  Raja Krishnamoorthi, an Illinois Democrat, asked. \\\"I'm not going to speak to that,\\\" Mueller said. \\\"In July 2017, the president said his personal finances were off limits or outside the per view of your investigation.  And he drew a red line around his personal finances. Were the president's personal finances outside the purview of your investigation? \\\" Krishnamoorthi asked. \\\"I'm not going to get into that,\\\" Mueller responded. \\\"Were you instructed by anyone not to investigate the president's personal finances? \\\" Krishnamoorthi said. \\\"No,\\\" Mueller answered. 3:13 pm Mueller said Trump's written answers were 'generally' not truthful\\\"Director Mueller, is it fair to say the president's written answers were not only inadequate and incomplete, because he didn't answer many of your questions, but where he did, his answers showed he wasn't always being truthful? ,\\\" Rep.  Val Demings, D-Fla. , asked. \\\"I would say generally,\\\" Mueller said. 3:03 p. m.  Mueller questioned on why he didn't subpoena Trump A Democrat posed a question that many in his party have asked from early in Mueller's investigation. \\\"Why didn't you subpoena the president? \\\" Rep.  Sean Maloney, D-N. Y. , asked. \\\"At the outset, after we took over the investigation and began and pursued it, one of the things we anticipated wanting to accomplish is getting the -- having the interview of the president,\\\" Mueller said.  \\\"We negotiated with him for a little over a year, and I think what you alluded to in the appendix lays out our expectations as a result of those negotiations.  But when we were almost toward the end of our investigation, we had no success to get the interview of the president, we decided we did not want to exercise the subpoena power because of the necessity of ending the investigations,\\\" Mueller said. \\\"Excuse me? \\\" Maloney said. \\\"If we did subpoena the president, he would fight the subpoena, and we would be under the investigation for a substantial period of time,\\\" Mueller said2:47 p. m.  Mueller said Russians are actively trying to interfere in U. S.  elections\\\"In your investigation, did you think that this was a single attempt by the Russians to get involved in our election?  Or did you find evidence to suggest they'll try to do this again? \\\" Rep.  Will Hurd, R-Texas, asked. \\\"It wasn't a single attempt.  They're doing it as we sit here.  And they expect to do it during the next campaign,\\\" Mueller said. 2:30 pm Mueller refuses to answer questions about Donald Trump Jr. After the hearing resumed, Mueller was asked about another matter that critics have questioned: his handling of the president's son. \\\"Did you want to interview Donald Trump Jr. ? \\\" Rep.  Eric Swalwell, D-Calif. , asked. \\\"I'm not going to discuss that,\\\" Mueller said. \\\"Did you subpoena Donald Trump Jr. ? \\\" Swalwell asked. \\\"I'm not going to discuss that,\\\" Mueller answered. 2:15 p. m.  Chairman Schiff calls a recess for 5-10 minutes after Mueller questioned about Trump and WikiLeaksThe plan was that Mueller would testify for about two hours before the House Intelligence Committee but aides said it could go somewhat longer. A few minutes earlier Rep.  Mike Quigley, an Illinois Democrat, ran through a series of slides showing Trump quotes about WikiLeaks, prompting Mueller to call Trump's encouraging comments \\\"problematic. \\\"\\\"If we could put up slide 6: 'This just came out.  Wikileaks.  I love WikiLeaks. ' Donald Trump, October 10, 2016.  'This WikiLeaks stuff is unbelievable.  You have to read it. ' October 12, 2016.  'This WikiLeaks is like a treasure trove. ' Donald Trump October 31, 2016.  'Boy, I love reading those WikiLeaks. ' Would any of those quotes disturb you, Mr.  Director? \\\" Quigley asked. \\\"How do you react to those?  \\\" Quigely asked\\\"It's problematic is an understatement to say the least - in terms of what it displays in terms of giving some hope or some boost to what is and should be illegal activity,\\\" Mueller answered. \\\"Donald Trump Jr.  had direct communications with WikiLeaks during the campaign period.  On October 3, 2016.  WikiLeaks penned another message to Trump Jr.  asking: \\\"You guys to have a link to Clinton.  Julian Assange responded to that, he had already done so.   This behavior at the very least disturbing? \\\"Disturbing and also subject to investigation,\\\" Mueller said. \\\"Could it be described as aide and comfort to a hostile service, sir? ?  Quigley pressed. \\\"I wouldn't characterize it with any specificity,\\\" Mueller said. 1:41 p. m.  Republican lawmaker presses Mueller on whether attorney general has authority to exonerate TrumpRep.  Mike Turner, R-Ohio, returned to Republicans' theme of questioning Mueller's decision not to exonerate Trump, something that has frustrated the president and his allies. With a screenshot of a CNN chyron from earlier Wednesday reading \\\"Mueller: Trump was not exonerated,\\\" Turner pressed Mueller on the issue. \\\"If your report is to the attorney general and the attorney general doesn't have the power to exonerate and he does not -- he knows that you do not have that power, you don't have to tell him that you're not exonerating the president.  He knows this already.  So then that kind of changes the context of the report,\\\" he said.  \\\"The attorney general has the power to exonerate?  He has not been given that authority. \\\"\\\"No,\\\" Mueller replied.  \\\"We included in the report for exactly that reason. \\\"\\\"You have no more power to declare him exonerated than you have the power to declare him Anderson Cooper,\\\" Turner said.  \\\"The statement about exoneration is misleading and meaningless and colors this investigation.  One word out of the entire portion of your report and it's a meaningless word that has no legal meaning and it has colored your entire report. \\\"\\\"Mr.  Mueller, would you agree with me that the attorney general does not have the power to exonerate? \\\" Turner continued. \\\"I'm going to pass on that,\\\" Mueller said. \\\"Why? \\\" Turner pressed. \\\"Because it embroils us in a legal discussion.  I'm not prepared to deal with a legal discussion in that arena,\\\" Mueller answered. 1:14 p. m.  Mueller said his investigation was not a witch hunt and that Russian interference is not a hoax, as Trump has claimed\\\"Your investigation is not a witch hunt, is it? \\\" Rep.  Adam Schiff, D-Calif. , asked. \\\"It is not a witch hunt,\\\" Mueller said. \\\"When the president said the Russian interference was a hoax, that was false, wasn't it,\\\" Schiff asked. \\\"True,\\\" Mueller answered. \\\"It's also clear from your report that during that Russian outreach to the Trump campaign, no one associated with the Trump campaign ever called the FBI to report it, am I right? \\\" Schiff asked. \\\"I don't know that for sure,\\\" Mueller said. \\\"In fact, the campaign welcomed the Russian help, did they not? \\\" Schiff asked. \\\"I think we report, in the report, say indications that that occurred, yes,\\\" Mueller answered. \\\"The president's son said when he was approached about dirt on Hillary Clinton, that the Trump campaign would love it,\\\" Schiff said. \\\"That's generally what was said, yes,\\\" Mueller said. \\\"The president himself called on the Russians to hack Hillary's emails? ,\\\" Schiff said. \\\"There's a statement by the president in those general lines,\\\" Mueller responded. \\\"Numerous times during the campaign, the president praised the releases of the Russian-hacked emails through Wikileaks? \\\" Schiff asked. \\\"That did occur,\\\" Mueller said. 1:09 p. m.  Mueller corrects earlier statement to Democratic lawmaker at first hearing\\\"Now, before we go to questions, I want to go back to one thing that was said this morning by Mr.  Lieu who said, and I quote, 'You didn't charge the president because of the OLC opinion',\\\" Mueller said, referring to the Justice Department Office of Legal Counsel opinion that it was against department policy to indict a sitting president.  \\\"That is not the correct way to say it.  As we say in the report, and as I said at the opening, we did not reach a determination as to whether the president committed a crime,\\\" Mueller explained. 1 p. m.  Top Republican gives opening remarks\\\"Welcome, everyone, to the last gasp of the Russia collusion conspiracy theory,\\\" Rep.  Devin Nunes, R-Calif. , said as he began his opening statement. \\\"Among congressional Democrats, the Russia investigation was never about finding the truth,\\\" he said as he finished.  \\\"It’s always been a simple media operation, and by their own accounts, that operation continues in this room today.  Once again, numerous pressing issues this Committee needs to address are put on hold to indulge the political fantasies of people who believed it was their destiny to serve in the Hillary Clinton administration.  It’s time for the curtain to close on the Russia hoax—the conspiracy theory is dead.  At some point, I would argue, we’re going to have to get back to work,\\\" Nunes said. 12:52 p. m.  Second hearing begins before House Intelligence Committee Rep.  Adam Schiff, the California Democrat who chairs the House Intelligence Committee, gaveled in another two hours of questioning of Robert Mueller. \\\"Your report, for those who have taken the time to study it, is methodical and it is devastating, for it tells the story of a foreign adversary’s sweeping and systematic intervention in a close U. S.  presidential election,\\\" he said in an opening statement. \\\"That should be enough to deserve the attention of every American, as you well point out.  But your report tells another story as well.  For the story of the 2016 presidential election is also a story about disloyalty to country, about greed, and about lies,\\\" he continued. \\\"Your investigation determined that the Trump campaign – including Trump himself – knew that a foreign power was intervening in our election and welcomed it, built Russian meddling into their strategy, and used it. \\\"Disloyalty to country.  Those are strong words, but how else are we to describe a presidential campaign which did not inform the authorities of a foreign offer of dirt on their opponent, which did not publicly shun it, or turn it away, but which instead invited it, encouraged it, and made full use of it? \\\" he said. 12:10 p. m.  First hearing endsMueller finished his testimony before the House Judiciary Committee after more than three hours of questioning.  After a break, Mueller would be testifying before members of the House Intelligence Committee about the section of his report dealing with whether there was collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russian government or individuals tied to that government. 12:07 p. m.  Mueller declines to comment on impeachment question\\\"Director Mueller, at your May 29, 2019, press conference, you explained that, quote, 'The opinion says that the Constitution requires a process other than the criminal justice system to formally accuse a sitting president of wrongdoing,' end quote.  That process, other than the criminal justice system for accusing a president of wrongdoing, is that impeachment? \\\", Rep.  Veronica Escobar, D-Texas, asked. She was the last Democrat to ask a question. \\\"I'm not going to comment on that,\\\" Mueller answered. \\\"In your report, you also wrote that you did not want to, quote, 'potentially preempt constitutional processes for addressing presidential misconduct,' end quote.  For the non-lawyers in the room, what did you mean by, quote, 'potentially preempt constitutional processes'? \\\"\\\"I'm not going to try to explain that,\\\" Mueller responded. \\\"That actually is coming from page 1 of Volume II.  In the footnote is the reference to this.  What are those constitutional processes? \\\" she pressed. \\\"I think I heard you mention at least one,\\\" Mueller answered. 12:01 p. m.  Democratic lawmaker questions Barr's summary of the Mueller report \\\"Could Attorney General Barr have avoided public confusion if he had released your summaries and executive introduction and summaries,\\\" Rep.  Madeleine Dean, D-Penn. , asked, referring to Barr's letter stating, in his view, the \\\"principal conclusions\\\" of Mueller's report, several weeks before the redacted report was released. \\\"I don't feel comfortable speculating on that,\\\" Mueller said, although he did send a letter to Barr stating his concerns that his report had been mischaracterized. 11:53 a. m.  Republicans end their questioning on impeachment issue A key question since his report was issued has been whether Mueller, because he believed he could not indict a sitting president, intended for Congress to deal with the issue through possible impeachment, according to the Constitution. \\\"One last important question.  Your report does not recommend impeachment.  Does it? \\\" Rep.  Mike Johnson, R-La. , asked. \\\"I'm not going to talk about recommendations,\\\" Mueller said. \\\"It does not conclude that impeachment would be appropriate here, right,\\\" Johnson added. \\\"I'm not going to talk about that issue,\\\" Mueller answered. 11:43 a. m.  Mueller emphatically defends his prosecution team against claims of political bias\\\"You must be aware by now that six of your lawyers donated $12,000 directly to Hillary Clinton.  I'm not even talking about the $49,000 they donated to other Democrats.  Just the donations to the opponent who was the target of your investigation,\\\" Rep.  Kelly Armstrong, R-N. D. , said. \\\"We strove to hire those individuals that could do the job.  I've been in this business for almost 25 years, and in those 25 years, I have not had occasion once to ask somebody about their political affiliation.  It is not done.  What I care about is the capability of the individual to do the job and do the job quickly and seriously and with integrity,\\\" Mueller said. 11:32 a. m.  Mueller denies he applied for job as FBI director \\\"A day before being named special counsel, did you indeed interview for the FBI director job one day before you were appointed special counsel? ,\\\" Rep.  Greg Steube, R-Fla. , asked, repeating a claim President Trump has made multiple times as evidence Mueller was \\\"conflicted\\\" and biased, allegedly because Trump rejected him. \\\"My understanding - it was not applying for the job.  I was asked to give my input on what it would take to do the job, which triggered the interview you're talking about,\\\" Mueller answered. \\\"So you don't recall on May 16, 2017, that you interviewed with the president regarding the FBI director job,\\\" Steube said, reminding Mueller that he was under oath. \\\"I interviewed with the president,\\\" Mueller said. \\\"Was it about the FBI director job? \\\" Steube added. \\\"It was about the job, not me applying for the job,\\\" Mueller said. \\\"So, did you tell the vice president that the FBI director position would be the one job that you would come back for? \\\" Steube asked. \\\"I don't recall that one,\\\" Mueller answered. 11:17 a. m.  Mueller pushes back on how GOP lawmaker characterizes his report\\\"Well, what you did is you compiled a nearly 450 pages of the very worst information you gathered against the target of your investigation, who happens to be the president of the United States.  And you did this knowing that you were not going to recommend charges and that the report would be made public,\\\" Rep.  Guy Reschenthaler, R-Penn. , said. \\\"Not true,\\\" Mueller responded. 10:58 a. m.  Mueller defends his report\\\"The fundamental problem is, as I said, we've got to take your word, that your team, faithfully, accurately, impartially, and completely described all of the underlying evidence in the Mueller report, and we're finding more and more instances where this just isn't the case.  And it's starting to look like, you know, having desperately tried and failed to make a legal case against the president, you made a political case instead. You put it in a paper sack, lit it on fire, dropped it on our porch, rang the doorbell, and ran,\\\" Rep.  Tom McClintock, R-Calif. , said. \\\"I don't think you’ve reviewed a report that is as thorough, as fair, as consistent as the report that we have in front of us,\\\" Mueller responded. 10:52 a. m.  Mueller explains why he did not indict Trump\\\"And I'd like to ask you the reason, again, that you did not indict Donald Trump is because of OLC opinion stating that you cannot indict a sitting president, correct,\\\" Rep.  Ted Lieu, D-Calif. , asked, referring to a Justice Department Office of Legal Counsel opinion that it was DOJ policy that a sitting president cannot be indicted. \\\"That is correct,\\\" Mueller said. 10:37 a. m.  Mueller said prosecutors can bring a charge of obstruction after a president leaves officeIn an especially significant moment, the former special counsel answered one of the key outstanding questions about his report during questioning by a Republican. \\\"Could you charge the president with a crime after he left office? \\\" Rep.  Ken Buck, R-Colo. , asked. \\\"Yes,\\\" Mueller said. \\\"You believe that he committed -- you could charge the president of the United States with obstruction of justice after he left office? \\\" Buck asked again. \\\"Yes,\\\" Mueller answered. 10:23 a. m.  Republican challenges Mueller on credibility of Christopher Steele\\\"I'm quoting from the Steele dossier, extensive evidence of conspiracy between the Trump campaign team and the Kremlin.  So here's my question: Did Russians really tell that to Christopher Steele or did he just make it all up and was he lying to the FBI,\\\" Rep.  Matt Gaetz, R-Fla. , asked. \\\"Let me back up a second if I could and say as I have said earlier with regard to the Steele -- that's beyond my purview,\\\" Mueller said. 10:06 a. m.  The committee takes a short breakSo far, there have been 21 instances of Mueller saying \\\"refer to the report,\\\" \\\"I'll leave that to our report,\\\" \\\"I direct you to the report,\\\" \\\"I'll leave the answer to the report,\\\" \\\"rely on the language of the report\\\"  -- answers along the lines of his previous statement that his report would be his \\\"testimony\\\" and that he would not go beyond it. 9:47 a. m.  Democrat asks about Trump's intention in wanting to fire Mueller\\\"Director Mueller, you found evidence as you lay out in your report that the president wanted to fire you because you were investigating him for obstruction of justice, isn't that correct,\\\" Rep.  Ted Deutch, D-Fla. , said. \\\"That's what it says in the report.  And yes, I stand by the report,\\\" Mueller said. Deutch then pivoted to ask Mueller about his report's finding that Trump ordered then-White House counsel Don McGhan to have then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions fire Mueller. \\\"You found White House counsel McGahn to be a credible witness, isn't that correct? \\\" Deutch said. \\\"Correct,\\\" Muller said. \\\"Director Mueller, the most important question I have for you today is why Director Mueller, why did the president of the United States want you fired? \\\" Deutch asked. \\\"I can't answer that question,\\\" Muller answered. 9:39 a. m.  Republican lawmaker asks Mueller about Peter Strzok controversy\\\"Peter Strzok hated Trump.  You didn't know that before he was made part of your team, is that what you're saying,\\\" Rep.  Louie Gohmert, R-Texas, asked about the former FBI agent who exchanged derogatory texts with former FBI lawyer Lisa Page, with whom he was having an affair. House Republicans and President Trump have repeatedly cited Strzok as evidence that Mueller's investigation was biased from the start. \\\"I did not know that.  And when I did find out, I acted swiftly to have him reassigned,\\\" Mueller answered. 9:08 a. m.  Republican argues Mueller didn't give Trump presumption of innocence Rep.  John Ratcliffe, R-Texas, a former U. S.  attorney, has a pointed back-and-forth with Mueller. He \\\"respectfully\\\" criticized Mueller's comments about not exonerating Trump in the report. \\\"Respectfully, respectfully, it was not the special counsel's job to conclusively determine President Trump's innocence,\\\" he said, \\\"because there is a presumption of innocence, prosecutors never, ever, need to determine it. \\\"\\\"Nowhere in here did it say write a report about decisions that weren't reached,\\\" Ratcliffe said. \\\"Americans need to know this as they listen to the Democrats and socialists on the other side of this aisle . . .  volume II was not authorized to be written under this law. \\\"\\\"Donald Trump is not above the law, but he damn sure shouldn't be below the law. \\\"9 a. m.  Top Republican presses Mueller on collusion\\\"Collusion is not a specific offense or a term of art in federal criminal law.  Conspiracy is.  In the colloquial context, collusion and conspiracy are essentially synonymous terms, correct? \\\" Rep.  Doug Collins, R-Ga. , asked. \\\"No,\\\" Mueller said. \\\"On page 180, Volume 1 of your report, it said collusion is largely synonymous with conspiracy as that crime is set forth.  Now, you said you chose your words carefully.  Are you contradicting your report right now? \\\" Collins asked. \\\"Not when I read it,\\\" Mueller answered. \\\"So, you would change your answer to yes, then? \\\" Collins asked. \\\"No,\\\" Mueller said. \\\"I'm reading your report, sir.  Is it a yes or no answer.  Page 180, Volume 1.  This is from your report,\\\" Collins added. \\\"Correct.  And I leave it with the report,\\\" Mueller said. 8:52 a. m.  Chairman Nadler asks the first question \\\"Director Mueller, the president has repeatedly claimed that your report found there was no obstruction and that it, completely and totally exonerated him.  But that is not what your report said, is it? \\\" Rep.  Jerry Nadler, D-N. Y. , asked. \\\"Right, that is not what the report said,\\\" Mueller said. Nadler then asks if the report totally exonerates Trump of obstruction of justice as the president has claimed. \\\"So.  the report did not conclude that he did not commit obstruction of justice?  Is that correct,\\\" Nadler said. \\\"That is correct,\\\" Mueller answered. \\\"And what about total exoneration?  Did you actually totally exonerate the president,\\\" Nadler asked. \\\"No,\\\" Mueller said. 8:42 a. m.  Mueller is sworn in\\\"It is unusual for a prosecutor to testify on a criminal investigation.  And given my role as a prosecutor there are reasons why my testimony will necessarily be limited,\\\" Mueller said in his opening statement. \\\"I also will not comment on the actions of the Attorney General or of Congress.   I was appointed as a prosecutor, and I intend to adhere to that role and to the Department’s standards that govern it,\\\" Mueller added. 8:36 a. m.  Judiciary Chairman Nadler gives opening statement\\\"Director Mueller, we have a responsibility to address the evidence that you have uncovered.  You recognize as much when you said, 'The Constitution requires a process other than the criminal justice system to formally accuse a sitting president of wrongdoing. ' That process begins with the work of this committee,\\\" Rep.  Jerry Nadler, D-N. Y. , said. \\\"This hearing is long overdue.  We’ve had the truth for months — no American conspired to throw our elections.  What we need today is to let that truth bring us confidence and closure,\\\" Rep.  Doug Collins, the top Republican on the committee, said in his opening statement. 8:33 a. m.  Mueller takes the witness chairIn a packed hearing room, Mueller takes a seat in the witness chair.  A top aide, Aaron Zebley, takes a seat just behind him. Shortly after Mueller sat down, a protester shouted: “Kushner and Manafort downloaded encrypted apps the day of the Trump Tower meeting” before getting pulled out of the room by Capitol Police. 7:53 a. m.  Mueller arrives on Capitol HillMueller arrived amid a crush of reporters and cameras for his congressional testimony in front of the House Judiciary Committee but made no comment. Mueller testifies first before the Judiciary Committee for three hours, before fielding questions from the House Intelligence Committee for two hours.  The first hearing will focus on Volume II of the Mueller report, which detailed ten instances of possible obstruction of justice by President Trump.  The second hearing will center on Volume I of the report, which focused on Russian efforts to interfere in the 2016 White House race. Lawmakers have spent weeks preparing for the hearings, and continued to prepare for the back-to-back rounds of questioning well into Tuesday evening, fielding a last-minute request from Mueller that Aaron Zebley, his longtime chief of staff, be sworn in to appear alongside him in front of the committees.  A committee spokesman said Zebley would appear with Mueller on Wednesday as his counsel. Democrats and Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee have each held mock hearings, with committee staffers playing the role of Mueller.  The former special counsel has prepared with a cadre of longtime aides at the WilmerHale law firm, where he worked before accepting the special counsel appointment.

This is the story of Kobe Bryant’s life Basketball legend Kobe Bryant is among nine people who died in a helicopter crash in the wealthy Southern California residential neighborhood of Calabasas, ABC News has confirmed. Bryant's 13-year-old daughter, Gianna, died alongside her father, NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said in a statement. Bryant was 41 years old. There were no survivors in the crash around 10 a. m.  local time Sunday, fire officials said in a press conference. Orange Coast College head baseball coach John Altobelli was also on board the aircraft, the school said in a statement.  The family later confirmed Altobelli's wife, Keri, and daughter, Alyssa, were also among those killed. The names of the other victims will not be publicly identified until next-of-kin are notified, Los Angeles County Sheriff Alex Villanueva told reporters. \\\"God bless their souls,\\\" Villanueva said, adding that members from the coroner's office are on their way to assist in the recovery of the remains. The Sikorsky S-76 helicopter crashed under unknown circumstances, a spokesperson from the National Transportation Safety Board told ABC News.  Firefighters worked to contain the quarter-acre brush fire that resulted, which was difficult to extinguish due to the presence of magnesium, which reacts to oxygen and water, Los Angeles County Fire Chief Daryl Osby told reporters. The debris from the aircraft was scattered on steep terrain, Osby said.  Paramedics on board an air ambulance were hoisted down to the scene but were not able to locate any survivors, he added. Witnesses who were mountain biking in the area saw the helicopter in distress, Los Angeles County Fire Capt.  Tony Imbrenda told reporters.  It is not known whether the pilot alerted over radio that the aircraft was in distress, Imbrenda said. It is unclear who the helicopter belonged to or where it originated from and was going to.  The National Transportation Safety Board and Federal Aviation Administration are investigating the crash. The FBI will also be helping the NTSB in its investigation because it has evidence response teams. While the cause of the crash is still unclear, the Los Angeles Police Department told ABC News it was not flying choppers on Sunday morning since the weather, specifically visibility, did not meet LAPD’s standards for flying. Bryant was drafted to the NBA out of high school in 1996 and spent his entire 20-year career with the Los Angeles Lakers, winning five NBA championships.  He was awarded NBA MVP in 2008 and NBA Finals MVP in 2009 and 2010. Bryant won gold medals as a member of the U. S.  men's basketball team in the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing and the 2012 Summer Olympics in London. LeBron James surpassed Bryant on the all-time scoring list on Saturday during the Lakers' game against the Philadelphia 76ers. \\\"I'm happy just to be in any conversation with Kobe Bean Bryant -- one of the all-time greatest basketball players to ever play, one of the all-time greatest Lakers,\\\" James told reporters after the game.  \\\"The man got two jerseys hanging up in Staples Center.  It's just crazy. \\\"Bryant tweeted at James congratulating him on beating his record. In 2018, Bryant won an Academy Award for his animated short \\\"Dear Basketball,\\\" based on a poem he wrote in 2015 when he announced his retirement. Bryant told \\\"Good Morning America\\\" anchor Robin Roberts in December 2015 that he wrote a letter to his fans upon retirement because he wanted to show how much they meant to him. \\\"The letter itself still doesn't do it justice and how important they've been -- how vital they've been in my career,\\\" he said.  \\\"And I mean, we grew up together.  And that's such a beautiful thing. \\\"Bryant was embroiled in controversy during a 2005 trial when he was accused of sexual assault by an employee at a Vail, Colorado, hotel.  Bryant always denied the encounter was nonconsensual and the case was later dismissed after the victim said she did not want to testify and the two parties settled a civil suitSilver said in a statement that the \\\"NBA family is devastated by the tragic passing\\\" of Bryant and his daughter and offered condolences to Bryant's wife, Vanessa, and their family. \\\"For 20 seasons, Kobe showed us what is possible when remarkable talent blends with an absolute devotion to winning,\\\" Silver's statement read.  \\\"He was one of the most extraordinary players in the history of our game with accomplishments that are legendary:  five NBA championships, an NBA MVP award, 18 NBA All-Star selections, and two Olympic gold medals.  But he will be remembered most for inspiring people around the world to pick up a basketball and compete to the very best of their ability.  He was generous with the wisdom he acquired and saw it as his mission to share it with future generations of players, taking special delight in passing down his love of the game to Gianna. \\\"Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti described Bryant in a statement as a \\\"giant who inspired, amazed, and thrilled people everywhere with his incomparable skill on the court -- and awed us with his intellect and humility as father, husband, creative genius, and ambassador for the game he loved. \\\"\\\"He will live forever in the heart of Los Angeles, and will be remembered through the ages as one of our greatest heroes,\\\" Garcetti said.  \\\"This is a moment that leaves us struggling to find words that express the magnitude of shock and sorrow we are all feeling right now, and I am keeping Kobe's entire family in my prayers at this time of unimaginable grief. \\\"The Lakers' next game will be against the Los Angeles Clippers Tuesday at the Staples Center at 7 p. m.  PT. Fans flocked to the scene of the crash, the Staples Center and the Kobe Bryant Gymnasium at the Lower Merion High School in Ardmore, Pennsylvania, where Bryant played basketball prior to being drafted, to mourn the fallen NBA star. In a statement, the school praised Bryant to raising \\\"the profiled of the high school\\\" and the school district, according to ABC Philadelphia station WPVI.  Bryant led the team to the 1996 state championship. \\\"Our school community will always be grateful for his ongoing generosity to his alma mater, including his dedication of our Kobe Bryant Gymnasium and his support of our boys' and girls' basketball teams. The NBA Player's Association wrote in a statement that it was \\\"stunned and devastated\\\" by the news of Bryant's death. \\\"Words cannot express his impact on our Players, the NBA and the game of basketball,\\\" the statement read.  \\\"This is a monumental loss for the entire basketball community and our hearts are quite simply broken.  We send love and prayers out to his wife Vanessa and the entire family. \\\"ABC News' Matthew Furhman, Matthew Foster, Darren Reynolds and Matthew Vann contributed to this report. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events\",\"document_ocr\":\"NEWS\\nwww. - Y\\nTWTESNOT\\nOMEMGRILL\\nESCOM\\n能ton\\nFed: forum\\n\",\"Category\":\"Insufficient_Text\"},{\"Id\":34873,\"claim_image\":\"http://pbs.twimg.com/media/EeAQCkYUMAIT8--.jpg?format=jpg&name=large\",\"claim\":\"BSP to file plea in Rajasthan High Court tomorrow against merger of its MLAs with Congress\\n\\nhttps://t.co/Wlff13nt4F https://t.co/t8RVsv9izg\",\"claim_ocr\":\"SP's B\\nRook\\\"\\nment K\\nrnama\\ny Strug\\ndden I\\nNe\\n\",\"document_image\":\"http://pbs.twimg.com/media/EcySNORUcAA0JYb.jpg?format=jpg&name=large\",\"document\":\"Mayawati-led Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) will file a plea in Rajasthan High Court tomorrow against the merger of its MLAs in the state with the Congress.

She said that the BSP supported the Congress unconditionally after the Assembly elections in Rajasthan.  “In Rajasthan, after elections results, the BSP gave unconditional support of all its six MLAs to Congress.  Unfortunately, chief minister Ashok Gehlot, out of his malicious intent and to damage the BSP, merged them with Congress in an unconstitutional.  He did the same even in his last tenure,” Mayawati said on Tuesday.  She said that the MLAs in question will lose their party membership if they don’t vote against the Congress in proceedings to be held during the assembly Session.  She said the party is willing to even move the Supreme Court.   BJP leader Madan Dilwar files another petition before Rajasthan High Court against the merger of six BSP MLAs in the state with Congress party.

Meanwhile, BJP leader Madan Dilawar on Tuesday filed another petition before the Rajasthan High Court against the BSP MLAs merger with Congress party.  This is his third petition against the merger.  In a relief to the Gehlot government, the High Court had dismissed Dilawar’s petition on Monday.

She should ready a letter pad with the words 'former CM' written on it,” Adhikari, who crossed over to the BJP recently, said while addressing a rally in Purba Medinipur district's Khejuri. Banerjee had said on Monday she will contest the assembly elections from both Nandigram and Bhawanipore constituencies.  Banerjee said that Nandigram is close to her heart and continues to remain special.  “Bhawanipore is my elder sister and Nandigram is my younger sister.  I will try to contest from both assembly constituencies.  The people of Bhawanipore may feel bad.  But I don’t want to hurt them.  If I can manage (to contest from both constituencies) it is okay.  But I will contest from Nandigram,” Banerjee had said at a rally in Nandigram on Monday. The war of words between Adhikari and Banerjee began soon after the chief minister’s announcement.  Adhikari challenged Mamata on Monday saying that he will resign from politics if he cannot defeat the Bengal chief minister by more than 50,000 votes.  “Write this down and mention the date and time.  I will leave politics if I cannot defeat her by half lakh (50,000) votes,” Adhikari said while addressing a rally in south Kolkata on the same day. The Bengal chief minister’s announcement has brought back Nandigram once more into the spotlight.  Nandigram remains important for both the chief minister and Suvendu Adhikari as the movement to protect farmers’ lands from acquisition 13 years ago catapulted both of them into the nation’s political stage. Adhikari was responsible for building the Trinamool Congress’ voter base in Jangalmahal, Nandigram and Purba Medinipur as the party’s youth leader.  Adhikari since joining the BJP in December has vowed to remove the Banerjee's government from power. Bengal will hold elections this year but incidents of political violence have cast a shadow over the polling process.  Buoyed by its performance in the state in the Lok Sabha elections in 2019, the state’s BJP unit remains confident that it will oust Banerjee from power in West Bengal assembly elections. \",\"document_ocr\":\"\",\"Category\":\"Insufficient_Text\"},{\"Id\":34875,\"claim_image\":\"http://pbs.twimg.com/media/EPFqJvjX0AATwqY.jpg?format=jpg&name=large\",\"claim\":\"\\\"That to me is the most chilling. ...

Trump’s defense team makes case for just 2 hoursPresident Donald Trump's defense team makes first day of opening arguments Trump's lawyers argue the charges are not impeachable, raise the Bidens Trump has called the Saturday trial session \\\"Death Valley in T. V. \\\" President Donald Trump's legal team Saturday took to the Senate floor to argue against the case made by the House impeachment managers over the past three days. The president’s lawyers also will have 24 hours over three days to persuade senators that the articles of impeachment charged -- abuse of power and obstruction of Congress -- do not amount to impeachable offenses. As Jay Sekulow, the president's personal attorney, predicted, they briefly brought up former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter, after Democrats raised them repeatedly in an effort to preempt the expected White House defense. They have argued that the president was justified in seeking an investigation into the Bidens by Ukraine because of a history of corruption involving the Ukrainian energy company Burisma. Sekulow has said his team plans to save the bulk of their defense for their second day of arguments on Monday.  He was accompanied by White House counsel Pat Cipollone and other White House lawyers on Saturday in an abbreviated session that lasted only about two hours. “Next week is when you’ll see the full presentation,” Sekulow told reporters Friday. Sekulow's comment came on the heels of a tweet by Trump equating Saturdays to “Death Valley in T. V. ”, signaling that he doesn't want his lawyers to deliver the case on Saturday when fewer people might be watching. Before Saturday's session began, Trump tweeted how Americans could watch his lawyers defend him. Here is how the day unfolded. Just before Cipollone ends the Trump team presentation for the day, he once again targets Schiff by recalling that Independent Counsel Ken Starr testified before the House during the Clinton impeachment. \\\"Do you know who else didn't show up in the Judiciary Committee to answer questions about his report in the way Ken Starr did in the Clinton impeachment?  Ken Starr was subjected to cross-examination by the president's counsel,\\\" Cipollone says.  \\\"Do you know who didn't show up in the Judiciary Committee?  Chairman Schiff. \\\"\\\"Now, they've come here today and they basically said let's cancel an election over a meeting with the Ukraine, with Ukraine,\\\" Cipollone says.  \\\"And as my colleagues have shown, they failed to give you key facts about the meeting and lots of other evidence that they produced themselves. \\\"\\\"Impeachment shouldn't be a shell game,\\\" Cipollone says.  \\\"They should give you the facts. \\\"In his closing remarks, Sekulow says,\\\"Impeachment shouldn't be a shell game.  We ask you, out of respect, to think about whether what you've heard would really suggest to anybody anything other that would be completely irresponsible abuse of power to do what they're asking you to do.  To stop an election, to interfere in an election, and remove the President of the United States from the ballot?  Let the people decide for themselves.  That's what the founders wanted.  That's what we should all want,\\\" he says. Deputy White House counsel Patrick Philbin begins by talking about \\\"issues related to obstruction and due process,\\\" outlining what he says are errors with the process in which the House handled the impeachment inquiry. He says House Speaker Nancy Pelosi didn't have the authority to begin impeaching the president without a full vote of the House. \\\"House Democrats skipped over that step completely.  What they had instead was simply a press conference from Speaker Pelosi announcing that she was directing committees to proceed with an impeachment inquiry against the President of the United States.  Speaker Pelosi didn't have the authority to delegate the power of the house to those committees on her own,\\\" he says. \\\"All of those subpoenas were invalid.  And that is what the Trump administration pointed out specifically to the house.  That was the reason for not responding to them because under long-settled precedent, there had to be a vote from the House to give authority. \\\"Philbin says the idea that President Trump was offered due process is \\\"simply inaccurate\\\" and claims that 78 days in the House is the fastest impeachment inquiry in U. S.  history. \\\"The president was given a choice of participating in a process that was going to already have the outcome determined.  The speaker had already said articles of impeachment we going to be drafted.  And there were no plans to hear from any fact witnesses.  That's not due process.  And that's why the president declined to participate in that process because the Judiciary Committee had already decided they were going to accept an ex parte record developed in manager Schiff's process, and there was no point in participating in that. \\\"\\\"They really weren't really interested in getting at the facts and the truth.  They had a timetable to meet.  They wanted to have impeachment done by Christmas, and that's what they were striving to do,\\\" he adds. Philbin criticizes that the whistleblower complaint has not been made public, an attack that many Republicans have echoed throughout the investigation. “We know from a letter that the inspector general of the intelligence community sent that he thought that the whistleblower had political bias,” Philbin says. ABC News’ Senior Congressional Correspondent Mary Bruce reports from inside the Senate Chamber:What a difference a day makes.  The Chamber appears to have woken up.  Both sides are paying very close attention.  From my vantage point, I didn't see a single empty chair. There's a lot more note-taking all around, but I am struck by how closely Democrats are paying attention today, especially compared to days past.  Many more of them are taking detailed notes.  And we know they have already begun submitting questions for the 16 hours of questioning that comes next. On the Republican side, the president's allies look quite pleased.  Lots of nodding and a few smirks Sens.  Graham and Ernst.  Sen.  Wicker laughed out loud when (Trump lawyer Mike) Purpura alleged it was a \\\"quid pro quo without a quo. \\\"The standouts continue to be Sens.  Collins, Murkowski and Romney who appear to be paying the closest attention on the GOP side. One other big difference -- the public seats are packed today.  Americans of all ages, intently listening as they observe history unfolding on the floor. \\\"Let me begin by saying that you cannot simply decide this case in a vacuum.  Mr.  Schiff said yesterday -- I believe it was his father who said -- you should put yourself in someone else's shoes.  Let's for a moment put ourselves in the shoes of the President of the United States right now,\\\" Jay Sekulow says. “Disagreeing with the president's decision on foreign policy matters or whose advice he's going to take is in no way an impeachable offense,” Sekulow says. Sekulow says that Democrats base their quid pro quo argument off the basis that a White House meeting between Trump and Zelenskiy did not happen. \\\"As if an article of impeachment could be based upon a meeting not taking place in the White House, but taking place someplace else like the United Nations General Assembly where it, in fact, did take place,\\\" he says. Sekulow also walks through President Trump's foreign policy toward other countries, attempting to show Ukraine was not treated any differently from others under Trump's foreign policy focused on \\\"burden-sharing. \\\"Sekulow argues that eliminating corruption in Ukraine was a central goal in U. S.  policy in Ukraine to explain Trump's motives. \\\"I am not going to continue to go over and over and over again the evidence that they did not put before you because we would be here for a lot longer than 24 hours.  But to say that the president of the United States did not -- was not concerned about burden sharing, that he was not concerned about corruption in Ukraine, the facts from their hearing, the facts from their hearing, establish exactly the opposite,\\\" Sekulow says. \\\"As everyone knows by now, President Trump asked President Zelenskiy to do 'us' a favor,\\\" Purpura says.  \\\"And he made clear that 'us' referred to our country, and not himself,\\\" he says, repeated a claim Trump had made himself in a tweet that Democrats dispute. \\\"There was no mention of the paused security assistance on the call and certainly not from President Trump,\\\" he says. Purpura homes in on comments made by Timothy Morrison, the former National Security Council Russia Director Republicans called to testify in the House Intelligence Committee's impeachment inquiry. \\\"Mr.  Morrison further testified that there was nothing improper and nothing illegal about anything that was said on the call.  In fact, Mr.  Morrison repeatedly testified that he disagreed with Lieutenant Colonel Vindman's assessment that President Trump made demands of President Zelenskiy or that he said anything improper at all,\\\" Purpura says, before playing a clip from Morrison's testimony. Purpura argues there was \\\"no quid pro quo on the call\\\" because Ukrainians weren't aware of the paused security assistance until Politico reported on it in August. \\\"There were numerous high-level diplomatic meetings between senior Ukrainian and U. S.  officials during the summer after the review on the security assistance began, but before President Zelenskiy learned of the hold through the Politico article.  If the Ukrainians had known about the hold, they would have raised it in one of those meetings, yet the Ukrainians didn't say anything about the hold at a single one of those meeting,\\\" Purpura says.  \\\"As soon as Ukrainians learned about the hold, they asked about it. \\\"(Democrats have pointed to testimony from two House witnesses to indicate that Ukraine was aware of the hold before the August article. )“The Democrats entire quid pro quo theory is based on nothing more than the initial speculation of one person.  Ambassador Sondland.  That speculation is wrong,” Purpura says, referring to the U. S.  Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland who has testified he was in direct contact with President Trump about the Ukraine aid matter. (The person who actually directed the White House Office of Management and Budget to withhold the military aid to Ukraine -- acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney -- explicitly acknowledged the quid pro quo in the White House briefing room on Oct.  17, 2019. )\\\"The House managers are aware that the Ukrainians lack of knowledge on the hold is fatal to their case, so they desperately tried to muddy the water,\\\" he says. Purpura argues that none of the witnesses called to testify in the House inquiry could say definitively whether the withheld security aid was tied to investigations into the Bidens. Another member of the president's legal team, Mike Purpura, opens his presentation with a video from November of lead House impeachment manager Adam Schiff  in which he reads a parody  version of the July 25 phone call transcript, comparing it to an organized crime \\\"shakedown. \\\"(Schiff, before speaking, said he was summarizing the \\\"essence\\\" of Trump's comments \\\"shorn of its rambling character,\\\" Schiff said. )Ukraine didn't know about the aid, he said, playing Volker and Taylor's testimony about Ukrainians questioning them about the hold following the August Politico article. (Democrats have pointed to testimony from two House witnesses – Cooper and Croft – to indicate that Ukraine was aware of the hold before the August article. )“The Democrats entire quid pro quo theory is based on nothing more than the initial speculation of one person.  Ambassador Sondland.  That speculation is wrong,” he said.  [10:55:08 AM]\\\"Once you sweep away all of the bluster and innuendo, the selective leaks, the closed-door examinations of the Democrats' hand-picked witnesses, the staged public hearings, what we're left with are six key facts that have not and will not change,\\\" Purpura says. He then lays out what he calls the \\\"six key facts. \\\"\\\"First, the transcript shows that the president did not condition either security assistance or a meeting on anything.  Second, President Zelenskiy and other Ukrainian officials repeatedly have said there was no quid pro quo and no pressure on them to review anything.  Third, President Zelenskiy and high-ranking Ukrainian officials did not even know -- did not even know -- the security assistance was paused until the end of August.  Over a month after the July 25 call.  Fourth, not a single witness testified that the president himself said that there was any connection between any investigations in security assistance, a presidential meeting or anything else.  Fifth, the security assistance flowed on September 11th, and a presidential meeting took place on September 25 without the Ukrainian government announcing any investigations. \\\"Finally, the Democrats' blind drive to impeach the president does not and cannot change the fact as attested to by the Democrats' own witnesses that President Trump has been a better friend and stronger supporter of Ukraine than his predecessor,\\\" he says. \\\"When it comes to sending U. S.  taxpayer money overseas, the president is focused on burden-sharing, and corruption,\\\" he argues.  \\\"There is absolutely nothing wrong with asking a foreign leader to help get to the bottom of our forms of foreign interference in American presidential election. \\\"Cipollone says \\\"they hid evidence from you. \\\"He says the president's team will show evidence that House managers \\\"decided over their three days and 24 hours that they didn't have enough time -- or made a decision not -- to show you.  And every time you see one of these pieces of evidence, ask yourself, 'why didn't I see that in the first 3 days. 'Cipollone cites a transcript of July 25, phone call between President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy -- saying Democrats did not mention how they discussed that European nations were not doing enough to support Ukraine. \\\"They come here to the Senate and they ask you, remove a president, tear up the ballots in all of your states, and they don't bother to read the key evidence of the discussion of burden-sharing that's in the call itself.  Now, that's emblematic of their entire presentation,\\\" Cipollone says.  \\\"They have the burden of proof.  And they have not come close to meeting it. \\\"\\\"We are going to be very respectful of your time. . . \\\" says White House counsel Pat Cipollone as he begins what he says will be a limited presentation. \\\"You heard the House managers speak for nearly 24 hours over three days,\\\" he says.  \\\"We don't anticipate using that much time. \\\"Then he comes out swinging against the House managers' arguments. \\\"We don't believe that they have come anywhere close to meeting their burden for what they're asking you to do,\\\" he tells senators. \\\"They're asking you not only to overturn the results of the last election, but as I've said before, they're asking you to remove President Trump from the ballot in an election that's occurring in approximately nine months,\\\" he says.  \\\"They're asking to you do something that no senate has ever done.  And they're asking to you do it with no evidence. \\\"\\\"The American people decide elections,\\\" Cipollone adds.  \\\"They have that coming up in nine months. \\\"\\\"So we will be very efficient.  We will begin our presentation today.  We will show you a lot of evidence that they should have showed you, and we will finish efficiently and quickly so that we can all go have an election,\\\" he says. ABC News' Benjamin Siegel reports, in a call with reporters earlier this morning, House Democrats said they expect the arguments from Trump’s legal team to be a “master class” in “distraction” and a “distortion” of truth. \\\"Just before the trial resumes, House manager Jerry Nadler and House staffers brought over carts of documents and legal files. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events\",\"document_ocr\":\"LIVE NEWS SPECIAL REPORT\\nIMPEACHMENT TRIAL OF PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP abc\\nITEO\\n\",\"Category\":\"Insufficient_Text\"},{\"Id\":34876,\"claim_image\":\"http://pbs.twimg.com/media/ErcQ1NTVgAEfH_b.jpg?format=jpg&name=large\",\"claim\":\"Indian Medical Association (IMA) has requested all its 3.5 lakh members in 1800 local branches to voluntarily come out to get vaccinated first to show to the world that the vaccines are safe and efficacious: IMA https://t.co/DHIs42lCKA\",\"claim_ocr\":\"INDIAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION (HQs.)\\nDr\\n(Registered under the Societies Act XXI of 1860)\\nMutually Affiliated with the British & Nepal Medical Associations\\nIMA House, Indraprastha Marg, New Delhi-110 002\\nTelephones +91-11-2337 0009 (10 ines), 23378680 / +91-9999116375, 9999116376, Fax +91-11-23379470\\nWebsite www.ima-india.org: Email: hsg@ima-india.org\\ntional President\\nr.

Friday’s drill will be the largest undertaken in the country so far.  A dry run was carried out in just eight districts on December 28-29.  The first countrywide drill covering 74 districts was held on January 2.  “The lessons learnt from the earlier exercise will be made use to execute another dry run.  Whatever was lacking earlier has been rectified, and will be tested in Friday’s dry run,” Union health minister Harsh Vardhan told states and Union Territories in an online meeting on Thursday. Vardhan, who faced questions about the timeline for receiving vaccine shots at the meeting, added: “It [supply of vaccines] is in works, and we will intimate you [states/UTs] all soon as we are moving towards the final stages of vaccination in the country. ” His remarks came on the day the Union health ministry said in a communique that states and UTs are likely to receive the first supply of Covid-19 vaccines shortly and asked them to remain prepared to accept the consignments.  India’s drug regulator on January 3 approved the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine and the indigenously developed Bharat Biotech vaccine for restricted emergency use in the country.  Officials have indicated that vaccination drive will begin in the second week of January. Friday’s mock drills are another attempt to test the infrastructure and the logistics that will play a major role in immunising the country of 1. 3 billion people, and familiarise district- and block-level officials on all aspects of Covid-19 roll-out.  The exercise will also involve testing the Co-WIN digital platform that will be the backbone of the Covid-19 vaccine delivery management system.

The expanding partnership between Chinese and Pakistani navies will also play an important role in maintaining peace in the IOR, Admiral M Amjad Khan Niazi told Chinese state media in an interview. Asked if China is building a naval base in Pakistan, Niazi said visits by navies will not change the “commercial” nature of the Beijing-built Gwadar port, even as he welcomed the visit of Chinese naval ships including aircraft carriers to Pakistani ports. He was speaking to the Chinese nationalist tabloid Global Times ahead of the multinational naval exercise AMAN-2021 to be hosted by Pakistan in February, where dozens of navies including from the US, UK, Japan, and Russia are expected to participate. Besides the multilateral exercise, the two countries have a bilateral naval drill “Sea Guardians”, the last edition of which was held in the northern Arabian Sea in January 2020. In the interview, Niazi accused India of destabilising the region, without evidence.  “On our eastern side, India, with an expansionist mindset, is destabilising the region by actions that could imperil regional security,” he said when asked about the maritime security environment in the IOR. He showered praise on China and its role in the IOR repeatedly.  “The PLA Navy has been sending its flotilla to the Gulf of Aden since 2009, which has contributed significantly toward maritime security in Indian Ocean region. “The PLA Navy’s consistent participation in Multinational Exercise AMAN since 2007 and conducting of bilateral exercises have been conducive to the overall maritime security environment in the Indian Ocean region. “The PLA Navy’s presence in the Indian Ocean region is thus an important element in maintaining the regional balance of power and promoting maritime security. ”Niazi went on to outline how valuable the cooperation between the navies of China and Pakistan is as the former continues to equip the latter’s sea forces with latest warships, submarines, and new technologies. “Naval collaboration between the two countries has been strengthened with the procurement of F-22P frigates, fast attack craft (missile), helicopters and state-of-the-art survey ship.  The PN has also contracted construction of eight Hangor-class submarines, four Type 054A/P ships and medium-altitude long-endurance unmanned combat aerial vehicles from China,” the Pakistani navy chief said. Pakistan is also looking to China to enhance its long-range anti-submarine warfare and anti-surface warfare capability through induction of long-range maritime patrol jets, unmanned combat aerial vehicles and modernising our existing fleet with state-of-the-art weapons and surveillance systems, Niazi said. “We are also looking at acquisition of modern helicopters, corvettes and shallow-water attack submarines,” he said. Niazi also spoke on the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor and how the Gwadar port is the initiative’s lynchpin. Cooperating with the Pakistani navy gives China reach across the IOR and the Arabian Sea, close to India’s west coast.  For Pakistan, it’s access to weapons and technology to counter India. “Chinese Navy hosts a number of modern and technologically advanced platforms in their inventory.  Operating with these modern and high-tech platforms affords us an opportunity to refine our tactics and procedures,” Niazi said. “It is heartening to know that the PLA Navy now operates two aircraft carriers.  The PN would like to conduct an exercise with these carriers whenever an opportunity arises.  Moreover, the PLA Navy and PN ships regularly visit each other’s ports.  In the same stride, the PN would continue to welcome further visits by PLA Navy ships, including aircraft carriers,” Niazi said. \",\"document_ocr\":\"KMTC.\\nCOSCO\\n\",\"Category\":\"Insufficient_Text\"},{\"Id\":34880,\"claim_image\":\"http://pbs.twimg.com/media/D0PAotLW0AIxE0c.jpg?format=jpg&name=large\",\"claim\":\"Hollywood's A-listers brought their A-game to the Oscars red carpet.

Speaking at a media conference in Bengaluru, DK Shivakumar, the new state Congress president, said that they had taken a verbal approval of the police commissioner for the event which was planned for June 14. “Earlier, it had been postponed twice on May 31 and June 7.  We had reserved 7,800 different locations across the state apart from 3,500 other places for Congress workers to participate in the ‘Pratijna Dina’ (oath day).  Despite clearly saying that only 150 people will assemble in the KPCC office itself, permission has been denied.  I am surprised at the vendetta politics unleashed by CM Yediyurappa,” said Shivakumar. The Congress high command had named Shivakumar as the new chief of the Karnataka unit on March 11 after incumbent Dinesh Gundu Rao resigned in December 2019 taking moral responsibility for the poor show in by-elections.  Since then, the Congress has been trying to hold an event for Shivakumar. Pointing out that BJP leaders in the state were participating in events where thousands have participated, Shivakumar questioned why there was no action against them and accused the government of double standards towards the opposition.  “BJP leaders in West Bengal and Bihar were holding mega rallies and is the law different for different political parties? ” Shivakumar said. Underscoring that he would continue to tour the state and meet people, Shivakumar said his party would explore the legal options available to hold the event. \",\"document_ocr\":\"\",\"Category\":\"Insufficient_Text\"},{\"Id\":34882,\"claim_image\":\"http://pbs.twimg.com/media/D0z_0pcUwAIF8CH.jpg?format=jpg&name=large\",\"claim\":\"Punjab(Pakistan) Minister Fayyaz ul Hassan Chohan: He is alive, Maulana Masood Azhar is alive, we have no information of his death. #Lahore https://t.co/Z3zNWvBjNe\",\"claim_ocr\":\"ANI\\nAN\\n\",\"document_image\":\"http://pbs.twimg.com/media/D0x4ASBUYAA9wwb.jpg?format=jpg&name=large\",\"document\":\"Intelligence agencies were trying to ascertain reports on social media about the death of Jaish-e-Mohammed terror group chief Masood Azhar in Pakistan, officials said on Sunday.  The officials said they had no information other than that Azhar was undergoing treatment at an army hospital after suffering renal failure.  A resident of Bahawalpur in Pakistan’s Punjab province, Azhar formed the Jaish-e-Mohammed in 2000.  The 50-year-old Azhar, who was released by the NDA government in 1999 in exchange of hostages of the hijacked Indian Airlines plane IC-814, has been accused of being the mastermind of the 2001 Parliament attack, suicide attack on Jammu and Kashmir state assembly, attack on Pathankot IAF base and the latest Pulwama terror strike. Social media was filled with reports that Azhar had died, but there was no confirmation as of now, the officials said.  Jaish’s Balakot camp, where training was imparted to recruits to carry out suicide attacks, was targeted by the IAF in an air strike last week, following the Pulwama terror attack in which 40 CRPF personnel were killed. The government has claimed that it achieved a spectacular success by destroying the facility. In an interview to CNN, Pakistan foreign minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi earlier admitted that the JeM chief is in Pakistan and is “very unwell”, but said the government can act against him only if India presents “solid” and “inalienable” evidence that can stand in a court of law. “He is in Pakistan, according to my information.

Beachfront condominium collapses in South FloridaAt least three people are dead and 99 others are unaccounted for after a 12-story residential building partially collapsed in southern Florida's Miami-Dade County early Thursday, officials said. The partial collapse of the Champlain Towers South condominium in the small, beachside town of Surfside, about 6 miles north of Miami Beach, was reported around 1:30 a. m.  local time.  The oceanfront complex has 136 units, and approximately 55 of them collapsed along the northeast corridor, according to Miami-Dade Fire Rescue Assistant Chief Raide Jadallah. A massive search and rescue operation was launched before dawn and crews are still carefully combing through the wreckage and remaining structure in hopes of finding survivors.  So far, crews have rescued 35 people who were trapped in the building and two others from beneath the rubble, Jadallah told reporters. A Miami-Dade County official confirmed to ABC News that the death toll was up to three. Teams of firefighters have been cutting through the rubble and placing sonar devices as part of the search efforts, which continued overnight.  Responders have not heard any voices coming from the pile but have picked up \\\"a possibility of a banging,\\\" according to Jadallah. \\\"This process is slow and methodical,\\\" Jadallah said during press conference in Surfside on Thursday afternoon.  \\\"Every time there's a shift in the rubble, we have additional rubble that shifts on us. \\\"Miami-Dade County Mayor Daniella Levine Cava told reporters that 102 people have now been accounted for but at leat 99 others remain missing.  She said search and rescue crews will be \\\"working around the clock. \\\"\\\"As the day comes to an end, their day does not,\\\" Levine Cava said during a press conference in Surfside on Thursday evening. \\\"We need to allow them to do their work because every minute in this search can make a huge difference,\\\" she said at an earlier press conference. Footage from the scene showed firefighters pulling a boy from the rubble alive and rescuing others from still-standing balconies. Jadallah told reporters that at least 11 people were medically assessed and treated on site, four of whom were then transported to local hospitals. Aventura Hospital and Medical Center said it has received three patients from the scene -- two in critical condition and one in fair condition -- while Jackson Health System said it received two patients. A \\\"substantial number\\\" of the condominium's residents are foreigners, according to Florida Sen.  Marco Rubio. Paraguay's foreign ministry said that six Paraguayan nationals were in the building and are still missing: Sophia López-Moreira, the sister of the country's first lady; her husband, Luis Pettengill; their three children; and their nanny, Lady Luna Villalba.  Paraguayan President Mario Abdo Benítez canceled his events due to the incident. Meanwhile, Argentina's consulate in Miami said that nine Argentine nationals are missing.  Venezuela's ambassador to the United States confirmed that four Venezuelan nationals are missing.  Uruguay's foreign ministry said that three Uruguayan nationals have been affected by the incident, though their status was unclear.  Colombia's foreign ministry also reported that six Colombian nationals resided in the condominium and officials were still trying to determine whether they were there at the time of the collapse. Florida resident Soriya Cohen told ABC News that her husband, Brad Cohen, a 51-year-old orthopedic surgeon, and her brother-in-law, Gary Cohen, a doctor visiting from Alabama, both are missing.  Soriya Cohen said they haven't been answering their phones and she does not have hope that they are alive. \\\"Just look at that rubble,\\\" Soriya Cohen told ABC News, pointing at the wreckage. She said she and her daughter were staying in a different home at the time because their family is in the process of moving.  Her son is currently studying abroad and trying to get home, she said. “It’s been surreal,” she added.  “My daughter has been in absolute shock. ”Gabe Nir, who lives in the Champlain Towers South with his mother and sister, told ABC News that they ran from the building when they heard the collapse. Nir said he felt a second, more intense collapse and that they ran for their lives as a thick cloud of white dust enveloped them, making it hard to breathe.  Nir, who compared the collapse to an earthquake, said he's grateful to be alive. Another witness told ABC News that his wife cares for an elderly woman who lives in the condominium and frantically called him around 1:15 a. m.  local time, after the units next door came crashing down.  He said his wife and the elderly woman both were rescued. A Miami-Dade county official told ABC News it's been difficult to determine how many people were in the collapsed section of the building, partly due to the fact that there isn't an on-scene management company that keeps track.  The condominium is a mix of full-time residents, seasonal residents, renters and short-term visitors, so authorities have been relying largely on neighbors and word of mouth. Miami-Dade County has an urban search and rescue team that has been dispatched to earthquakes and other disasters all around the world, but this is the first time that the team has been deployed on home turf, according to the official. The official told ABC News that there's real concern about the structural integrity of the remaining building, particularly from dangling wires and portions of concrete.  Fires have flared up throughout the day, adding to the danger for the search and rescue teams, the official said. The unaffected section of the condominium was cleared as of 8 a. m.  local time.  But due to the lingering dangers, several blocks of the complex will be closed for the next week, according to the official. Surfside Mayor Charles Burkett called the partial collapse a \\\"catastrophe. \\\" He told reporters that the condominium was built in the 1980s and was believed to be substantially full at the time of the partial collapse.  The building was undergoing roof work, he said. Some 15 families escaped the building on their own and were put up in a local hotel, according to Burkett.  Search dogs did an initial pass around the wreckage when it was still dark and the site was considered dangerous, but there were no signs of survivors at that time, the mayor said. Surfside Commissioner Nelly Velasquez told ABC News that the building was up for its 40-year recertification. The Champlain Towers South Condo Association was preparing to start a new construction project to make updates and the condominium had been through extensive inspections, according to Kenneth Direktor, a lawyer for the association.  Direktor said that he hadn't been warned of any structural issues with the building or about the land it was built on.  He said there was water damage to the complex, but that is common for oceanfront properties and wouldn't have caused the collapse. \\\"Nothing like this has ever been seen, at least not in the 40 years I've been doing this,\\\" Direktor told ABC News. Florida Gov.  Ron DeSantis toured the site, telling reporters it was \\\"traumatic to see. \\\"\\\"It's a tragic day,\\\" DeSantis said during a press conference in Surfside on Thursday afternoon.  \\\"We still have hope to be able to identify additional survivors. \\\"The governor declared a state of emergency in Miami-Dade County that evening \\\"to provide assistance for the families impacted by the Surfside tragedy,\\\" according to the order. U. S.  President Joe Biden told reporters that he spoke with the Miami-Dade County mayor as well as U. S.  Rep.  Debbie Wasserman Schultz, who represents the Florida district. Biden said he was waiting on the governor to ask for an emergency declaration, but he is \\\"ready to move from the federal resources immediately, immediately, if in fact we're asked for it. \\\"The cause of the collapse was unknown.  The Miami-Dade Police Department is leading an investigation into the incident. \\\"Our goal is to provide a thorough investigation and closure for our families,\\\" Freddy Ramirez, director of the Miami-Dade Police Department, said during a press conference in Surfside on Thursday morning. Authorities have opened a family assistance center at the Surfside recreational center for individuals unable to locate loved ones who live in the Champlain Towers South.  Anyone with family members from the condominium who are either safe or still missing is urged to call 305-614-1819 to account for them.

The team recovered hundreds of litres of illicit liquor and destroyed it on the spot.  About 20 cows drank the liquor and fell ill.  Three cows died on Saturday while the two died on Sunday.  The carcasses were buried after post mortem.  The remaining 15 cows are being treated in a camp of the veterinary department,” said G Das, deputy director animal husbandry department.

The Baylor Lady Bears will be the first women’s championship team to make a solo visit since Trump took office, according to the Washington Post.  \\n\\n  Trump has hosted victorious men’s athletic teams several times over the course of his presidency.  There have been events honoring the Clemson and Alabama men’s football teams, the 2017 Super Bowl champ New England Patriots, the Stanley Cup-winning Washington Capitals hockey team and NASCAR Monster Energy Cup Series champion Martin Truex, among others.  \\n\\n  Coming to the White House, however, has been a controversial decision for some invited teams during the Trump administration. \\n\\n  When the White House hosted a 2017 event honoring multiple NCAA championship teams from a variety of sports, the South Carolina women’s basketball team declined the invitation. \\n\\n  Last year, Trump canceled a visit from the Super Bowl champion Philadelphia Eagles team. \\n\\n  “The Philadelphia Eagles are unable to come to the White House with their full team to be celebrated tomorrow,” Trump said in a statement at the time.  “They disagree with their President because he insists that they proudly stand for the National Anthem, hand on heart, in honor of the great men and women of our military and the people of our country.  The Eagles wanted to send a smaller delegation, but the 1,000 fans planning to attend the event deserve better. ”\\n\\n  The NBA champion Golden State Warriors declined an invitation from the President to visit the White House after winning the 2017 championship. \\n\\n  Individual players also have refused those invitations in the past – Boston Bruins goaltender Tim Thomas declined to visit the White House in 2012 over disagreements with President Barack Obama’s policies. \\n\\n  CNN’s Betsy Klein contributed to this report.  \\n© 2021 Cable News Network.

Hema Malini, who was visiting her parliamentary constituency after 10 months, interacted with the media on Wednesday. “Farmers should say what is wrong in the farm laws and what needs to be done.  Farmers are opposing farm laws without understanding them.  During talks with the Centre, farmer representatives do not point out any problems in the farm laws but simply call for their withdrawal.  If farmers understand, they will find the farm laws to be beneficial,’” said Malini. She accused the opposition of hypocritical behaviour on the issue.  ‘The Opposition is opposing the farm laws just for the sake of it.  Congress wanted to bring such laws during their regime but is now opposing them,” Malini said, while welcoming the Supreme Court order aimed to break the deadlock between the protesting farmers and the Central government. Speaking in favour of setting up industries in Mathura, the BJP MP favoured decreasing the area of Taj Trapezium Zone so that big industries could come up in Mathura.

Michael Cohen's statement: Trump is 'a racist,' aware of email leaksRep.  Kathleen Rice, D-N. Y. , asked the House Ethics Committee Tuesday to investigate a tweet from a Republican congressman about Michael Cohen ahead of his public testimony before Congress, a move that could prompt an official investigation. In a letter to the panel, Rice said she believes Rep.  Matt Gaetz's controversial tweet Tuesday evening, which implied alleged details about Cohen's romantic life could come out during Cohen’s public testimony, constituted witness tampering. Gaetz, a self-described Trump loyalist, tweeted: “Hey @MichaelCohen212 - Do your wife & father-in-law know about your girlfriends?  Maybe tonight would be a good time for that chat.  I wonder if she’ll remain faithful when you’re in prison.  She’s about to learn a lot. . . ”\\\"As a former District Attorney and federal prosecutor, I believe this statement is in violation of 18 U. S.  Code 1512, which clearly defines witness tampering and intimidation,\\\" she wrote in the letter obtained by ABC News.  \\\"According to the Department of Justice . . .  this statute applies to proceedings before Congress. \\\"Rice, who encouraged the committee to refer the matter to the Justice Department after an investigation, discussed the tweet with Gaetz on the House floor Tuesday evening, according to a source familiar with their conversation. Under its rules, the House ethics panel could launch an investigation into the matter from the referral.  A committee official declined to comment on Rice's referral. After a committee investigation, the panel could eventually recommend the House vote to reprimand, censure or fine Gaetz, Bryson Morgan, a former investigative counsel for the House of Representatives Office of Congressional Ethics, told ABC News. The panel could also recommend expulsion, which would require a two-thirds majority of the chamber. Gaetz was questioned by reporters moments after his tweet and why he wrote it, saying “the tweet speaks for itself. \\\"Gaetz was asked if the tweet should be perceived as a threat telling reporters, “Absolutely not.  We’re witness testing not witness tampering.  And when witnesses come before Congress their truthfulness and voracity ought to be tested and we have the opportunity. ”Gaetz apologized in a later tweet around midnight Wednesday and said he planned to delete the inflammatory Cohen tweet. \\\"Speaker, I want to get the truth too.  While it is important 2 create context around the testimony of liars like Michael Cohen, it was NOT my intent to threaten, as some believe I did,\\\" he said in a response to a tweet from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif.  \\\"I’m deleting the tweet & I should have chosen words that better showed my intent.  I’m sorry. \\\"Lanny J.  Davis, an attorney for Michael Cohen, said: \\\"We will not respond to Mr.  Gaetz’s despicable lies and personal smears, except to say we trust that his colleagues in the House, both Republicans and Democrats, will repudiate his words and his conduct.  I also trust that his constituents will not appreciate that their congressman has set a new low — which in today’s political culture is hard to imagine as possible. ”The tweet from Gaetz was a stunning attack from a member of Congress ahead of public testimony. “I think it’s enough to warrant an investigation.  This is knowingly using intimidation . . .  with the intent to influence or delay or prevent the testimony,” said Melanie Sloan, a former federal prosecutor, senior adviser to American Oversight, a government watchdog group referring to the federal code.  “This guy could be charged with witness tampering. ”Asked for any proof about his allegations against Cohen, Gaetz told ABC News \\\"tune in tomorrow and find out. \\\" Gaetz is not a member of the House Oversight Committee, which will question Cohen tomorrow for his first public hearing. Cohen has been testifying before members and staff of the Senate Intelligence Committee behind closed doors since first thing Tuesday morning. The longtime Trump Organization employee plead guilty to lying to Congress as well as financial crimes including bank and tax fraud late last year.  Cohen also pleaded guilty to campaign finance violation for payments made to adult film star Stormy Daniels during the 2016 presidential campaign. A source familiar with his public testimony plans for Wednesday told ABC News Cohen is expected to publicly accuse President Trump of potentially committing a crime while in office.  The accusation, according to the source, is related to Trump's alleged repayment of money to Cohen for his deal with Daniels.  Trump has denied Daniels' claim but has admitted to the reimbursement. Trump has denied the affair alleged by Daniels and another accusation from former Playboy model Karen McDougal, and has previously said the payment amounted to nothing more than a “simple private transaction,” and that they do not qualify as campaign finance violations.

Trump's lawyers addressed and dismissed reported allegations by Bolton that Trump told him he was withholding military aid to Ukraine until Ukraine agreed to investigate the Bidens. They argued, even if true, that doesn't constitute an impeachable offense. The next phase of the trial -- in which senators will submit questions to both sides for up to 16 hours -- is expected to begin Wednesday.  After that, a pivotal point in the trial -- a Senate vote on whether to consider new witnesses and other evidence -- could come as early as Friday. The ABC News team of correspondents and producers is covering every aspect of this story. Here is how the day unfolded. White House counsel Pat Cippollone ends three days of arguments with a low-key but impassioned plea to senators. \\\"The Senate cannot allow this to happen.  It is time for this to end here and now. ,' he says.  \\\"So, we urge the Senate to reject these articles of impeachment for all the reasons we have given you. \\\"Cipollone tells the senators to end the era of impeachment \\\"for good. \\\"'This should end now, as quickly as possible,\\\" he argues.  \\\"Reject these articles of impeachment for our country and for the American people. \\\"Cipollone spoke after a brief recess. As that recess began, Sen.  Susan Collins turned to her GOP colleague and seat mate Sen.  Lisa Murkowski and both huddled, intensely in their seats - talking just to one another, ABC's Trish Turner reports from the chamber.  Each is resting her head in hand -- as if to shield what is being said from press and potentially GOP colleagues all around them. They are two key senators on the question of witnesses.  Most stopped taking notes during the Sekulow comments. And ABC's Devin Dwyer reports that after Murkowski and Collins broke the Alaska senator stood in the aisle shoulder to shoulder with GOP Whip Sen John Thune for over 10 minutes, both clearly presenting countering views on the question of witnesses. Thune, heavily chewing gum, looked sternly away while Murkowski seemed to thoughtfully lay out her thinking into his left ear.  You could see her saying \\\"witnesses\\\" but exact statements not clear. Murkowski’s body language and facial expressions seemed to reflect the conflicted views she has made publicly in recent days. I can overhear her saying \\\". . . . imagine if it was someone else. . . \\\" and \\\". . .  I do understand the concerns. . . \\\" and \\\". . . .  there’s no way anyone wants that. . . . \\\" She occasionally shrugs her shoulders. Jay Sekulow, one of the president's lead lawyers, takes the Senate floor to sum up the team's arguments, and appears to reference the Bolton manuscript controversy, saying \\\"The trial of the leader of the free world and the duly elected President of the United States is one of the most solemn of duties.  It is not a game of leaks and unsourced manuscripts. \\\"\\\"You cannot impeach a president based on an unsourced allegation,\\\" he says later, this time mentioning Bolton by name and the president's denial of his allegation that he heard him tie withholding Ukraine aid to Ukraine agreeing to an investigation of the Bidens. Sekulow also says all the legal scholars the president's lawyers have presented have warned against lowering the bar for impeachment, saying it would set a bad precedent. \\\"Hamilton put impeachment in the hands of this body, the Senate, precisely and specifically to be above that fray.  This is the greatest deliberative body on Earth.  In our presentation so far, you have now heard from legal scholars from a variety of schools of thought, from a variety of political backgrounds, but they do have a common theme with a dire warning, danger.  Danger.  Danger,\\\" he says. \\\"To lower the bar of impeachment based on these articles of impeachment would impact the functioning of our constitutional republic and the framework of that Constitution for generations,\\\" he continues, attacking Democrats. \\\"The claim that foreign policy decisions can be deemed abuses of power based on subjective opinions about mixed or sole motives that the president was interested only in helping himself demonstrate the dangers of employing the vague, subjective and politically malleable phrase, abuse of power as a constitutionally permissible criteria for the removal of a president,\\\" he says, echoing the argument from Alan Dershowitz on Monday night. . Sekulow connects that idea to The New York Times report of excerpts from Bolton's book that has increased calls for Bolton's testimony.  But Sekulow says that even if those comments are true the president's behavior still isn't an impeachable offense. Senators are paying attention, but only a few appear to be taking notes, ABC's Mary Bruce notes from the Senate gallery. Sen.  Susan Collins is still the most prolific note taker.  And a new name stands out, Bill Cassidy of Louisiana.  He is also paying close attention. Romney is listening and looked slightly unamused during the more political portion of Sekulow's remarks. Before things got underway, Sen.  Liindsey Graham was seen speaking very briefly to Collins and Cassidy, separately. Graham genuinely seems bored.  He is snapping his gum, staring at the wall and constantly leaving the chamber for long stretches. The most activity in the room is happening at the Trump legal team and managers' tables. From my vantage point, I could see directly over Sekulow's shoulder as he tweaked and rewrote the top of his remarks.  Notable, since the beginning of his comments included a not-so-subtle reference to Bolton's allegations, saying \\\"It's not a game of leaks and unsourced manuscripts. \\\"The managers did not make eye contact when Sekulow ripped into their handling of the House impeachment process.  But Schiff is taking non-stop notes.  And there was a lot of chatter among members of the team throughout the presentations. I think it’s fair to say no one here really yet knows the outcome of the question of whether or not to call witnesses, ABC's Trish Turner says in analysis. There’s a blizzard of spin and pressure being brought to bear against GOP senators. White House Legislative Affairs Director Eric Ueland has been making the rounds pressing GOP senators to oppose the vote on calling witnesses, according to 2 GOP senators requesting anonymity who were contacted by Ueland. One senior administration official tells ABC the case is basically this:\\\"This could add weeks if not months to a potential trial process and lead to some very challenging outcomes for the Senate as an institution, the court itself, and obviously how it would handle executive privilege issues out in the executive branch and in Congress. So, for example, is there supposed to be one set of rules for executive privilege and classified information for Senate presidential impeachment trials only and one set of rules for everything else?  There are some real practical challenges that start to crop up pretty quickly. \\\"The source noted there are real-time implications and concerns about executive privilege assertions.  You could see a situation, the source says, where \\\"every question that rotates around executive privilege having to go to a court for adjudication – every one of those questions is a time process.  This is a question by question affirmation of executive privilege which is held by the president, not by Ambassador Bolton. \\\"There’s also a challenge \\\"about the availability of information. \\\"As for releasing the Bolton manuscript in a classified setting, the official said \\\"Lots of people have talked about this, but there are lots of attendant complexities. \\\"Who owns the manuscript?  The publisher?  Is it Bolton’s?  The marketer’s?   The administration official said this might not be a White House or Senate question to be answered.  This source said the White House has \\\"little visibility\\\" into this. Some of the concern is abated by addressing this in a classified setting but to put it mildly, the administration wouldn’t trust that the information would stay classified. The document could also still be subject to privilege assertions. That’s why they handled it very carefully on the Senate floor, versus the speculation in the media. There are \\\"complex and somewhat novel legal issues suddenly front and senator courtesy of the article,\\\" the official said. Where is the Trump administration on the witness vote?  \\\"No predictions,\\\" the official said. Tuesday's trial session gets underway with White House deputy counsel Patrick Philbin saying he wants to elaborate on arguments made last night by former Harvard Law School professor Alan Dershowitz.  He argued that a president cannot be impeached for \\\"abuse of power\\\" and \\\"obstruction of Congress\\\" because the language is too vague -- that the Constitution requires a crime or something like a crime. Philbin also asks, \\\"How do we tell what an illicit motive is?  How do we get inside the president's head? \\\" regarding what he says are Trump's lawful actions on their face. Philbin specifically says there was no malicious intent in the decision to move the rough transcript of the July 25 call between Presidents Trump and Zelenskiy to a more highly restricted server, citing testimony from witnesses that they did not believe that was done to hide any perceived wrongdoing in the call.  He plays testimony from U. S.  Army Lt.  Col.  Alexander Vindman and National Security Council official Tim Morrison. \\\"So, why we're even here talking about these accusations about a cover-up when it's a transcript that was preserved and made public is somewhat absurd? \\\" Philbin says. He also countered Democrats' argument that the whistleblower complaint that first raised concerns about the call and the administration's dealings with Ukraine should have been provided immediately to Congress once it was deemed to be a matter of \\\"urgent concern. \\\"Philbin argues the law doesn't say if the matter is urgent it has to be shared immediately, but specifically defines \\\"urgent concern\\\" as a serious or flagrant problem, violation of law as it relates to funding, or interference in intelligence matters.  He said the Office of Legal Counsel at the Justice Department looked at the complaint and determined it did not meet the definition of \\\"urgent concern. \\\"\\\"Remember what we're talking about here is a head of state communication between the president of the United States and another head of state.  This isn't some CIA operation overseas.  This isn't the NSA doing something.  This isn't any intelligence activity going on within the intelligence community under the supervision of the DNI.  It's the head of the executive branch exercising his constitutional authority, engaging with foreign relations with a foreign head of state,\\\" he says. GOP moderate Sen.  Lisa Murkowski of Alaska is signaling that she is increasingly likely to support hearing from John Bolton.  Asked if she wants to read his manuscript, she says, \\\"I think that Bolton probably has something to offer us.  So we’ll figure out how we’re going to learn more,\\\" she said, before hopping into an elevator. --ABC News Mariam KhanGOP Sen.  James Lankford, who late Monday floated the idea of reviewing Bolton’s manuscript, tells CNN the review is necessary before senators can decide whether to call him as a witness. \\\"This at least allows people to reach a decision based on facts that they can actually read in the manuscript,\\\" Lankford says. The National Security Council, which is based at the White House, has held Bolton’s manuscript since he submitted it for a standard review process last month, according to a Bolton representative and an NSC spokesperson. Sen.  Mitt Romney, one of the key moderates Democrats hope will support new testimony, again appears open to new testimony.  But he goes further on Tuesday, suggesting he’s just as open to hearing from other witnesses called by Trump’s defense team. \\\"I'd like to hear from John Bolton and I think the idea that's been expressed in the media about having each side be able to choose a witness or maybe more than one witness on a paired basis, it has some merit,\\\" Romney tells reporters. Some Republicans and Democrats have reportedly considered calling former Vice President Joe Biden to the Senate floor in exchange for senior officials with closer connections to the President. But Democratic senators have publicly rejected the idea, insisting the accusations that the Bidens engaged in Ukraine-related corruption are baseless distractions. --ABC News' Sarah KolinovskySenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer makes another argument for witnesses before Trump's impeachment trial convenes at 1 p. m. He notes that with the president's denial of John Bolton's allegation on Monday, the two are telling opposing stories and says, since Trump won't testify, senators need to hear from Bolton to decide who's telling the truth. He says it's \\\"on the shoulders of four Republican senators\\\" to make sure Bolton, acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney and two other administration officials testify, referring to GOP Sens.  Mitt Romney, Susan Collins, Lisa Murkowski and Lamar Alexander. He also called the GOP talk of having senators read the Bolton manuscript in a secure setting is an \\\"absurd proposal. \\\"\\\"Nothing is a substitute for a witness testifying under oath,\\\" Schumer says. \\\"We're not bargaining with them,\\\" Schumer says of Republican talk of having Hunter Biden testify in exchange for Bolton appearing. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events\",\"document_ocr\":\"abc NEWS LIVE\\nanimo\\n\",\"Category\":\"Insufficient_Text\"},{\"Id\":34891,\"claim_image\":\"http://pbs.twimg.com/media/D0fer78WsAAZcTI.jpg?format=jpg&name=large\",\"claim\":\"CNN's @DonLemon: \\\"You cannot care about one lie or liar and then dismiss another.

What we learned from Michael Cohen's House Oversight Committee testimonyMichael Cohen, President Donald Trump's former lawyer and fixer, testifed publicly for the first time Wednesday about his experience in the Trump orbit before the House Oversight Committee, painting a harsh portrait of the president as an unscrupulous businessman who may have committed a crime while in office. Cohen also repeated what he said in a copy of his prepared remarks obtained by ABC News, claiming that Trump, as a candidate, knew his longtime confidant Roger Stone was talking with Julian Assange about WikiLeaks' possibly revealing emails hacked from the Democratic National Committee. In a statement to ABC News on Wednesday morning, Stone denied Cohen's allegation.  Julian Assange attorney Barry Pollack, in a statement, said, “Roger Stone did not have the telephone call Michael Cohen described. \\\"Here is how the hearing unfolded:5:20 p. m.  – Committee chairman in closing remarks: ‘We are better than this’In a fiery and impassioned speech to close out Wednesday’s blockbuster hearing after more than seven hours, Rep.  Elijah Cummings, D-Md. , called on members of his committee to “be better” as he sympathized with Cohen’s position. “We are better than this.  We are so much—we really are.  We are so much better than this,” Cummings said, adding, “when we are dancing with the angels, the question will be asked: in 2019 what did we do? ”Cummings’ sentiment drew an emotional response from Cohen, who appeared to be holding back tears when the chairman invoked the harm Cohen’s actions has caused his family. When he finished, Cummings pounded his gavel and adjourned the hearing more than seven hours after gaveling it in. 5:05 p. m.  – Cohen: If Trump loses 2020 election, 'I fear' there won’t be a peaceful transition of powerIn a dramatic statement at the conclusion of Wednesday’s hearing, Michael Cohen made a startling prediction: If President Trump fails to win a reelection bid in 2020, he may not give up his grip on power. “Given my experience working for President Trump, I fear that if he loses the election in 2020 that there will never be a peaceful transition of power,” Cohen said.  “This is why I agreed to appear before you today. ”Cohen then called on President Trump to cease attacks on the media, Gold Star families, and others. “You don't vilify people based on the god they pray to and you don't cuddle up to our adversaries at the expense of our allies,” Cohen said.  “You don't shut down to appease your base.  This behavior the office of the president and it simply is un-American. ”4:55 p. m.  – Democrat accuses GOP committee member of 'racist act'Rep.  Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich. , accused a Republican colleague of using a “black woman as a prop” during Wednesday’s testimony, sparking uproar from Republicans on the committee and calls for her comments to be stricken from the record. Tlaib’s statement came in response to Rep.  Mark Meadows, R-N. C. , inviting Lynne Patton, a current Department of Housing and Urban Development official and former longtime Trump Organization employee, to Wednesday’s hearing.  Meadows asked to include Patton’s statement defending Trump against accusations that he is “a racist” into the record.  Patton is a black woman. Meadows took issue with Tlaib’s remarks, offering an emotional rebuttal and defending his record of advocating civil rights for racial minorities. Tlaib clarified that she does not believe Meadows is a racist but accused him of “a racist act. ”4:45 p. m.  – Rep.  Ocasio-Cortez questions Cohen over Trump golf coursesIn a line of questioning by Rep.  Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N. Y. , Michael Cohen described how he said Donald Trump sought to garner tax deductions by reducing the value of his golf properties. Asked how the president did so, Cohen said, “you deflate the value of the asset and put in a request to the tax department for a deduction. ”Rep.  Ocasio-Cortez cited a lengthy New York Times article published in October describing “dubious tax schemes” Trump engaged in during the 1990s. 4:27 p. m.  – Hearing resumes after lengthy recessAfter a nearly two hour break -- an hour longer than stated -- members of the committee and Michael Cohen have returned to their seats for the final leg of questioning.  Overall, Cohen seems to have fended off most Republican attacks on him so far by taking a non-combative approach and repeatedly asserting that while he's lied previously, he's telling the truth now. 2:30 p. m.  – Stormy Daniels weighs in: ‘Michael, I’m proud of you’Shortly before the committee took what was expected to about an hour break for lunch, the adult film actress at the heart of president’s hush money payments controversy released a statement during Cohen’s testimony, saying she’s “proud” of Cohen for “finally beginning to tell the truth about what you did. ”Stormy Daniels, whose name has been repeatedly invoked over the course of Wednesday’s hearing for her role as the recipient of a hush money payment, appeared moved by Cohen’s testimony. “I can hear the pain and regret you feel for betraying your family and your country,” she said.  “Thank you for having the courage, at long last, to begin to tell the truth. ”Cohen executed the $130,000 payment to Daniels prior to the 2016 election.  President Trump has denied having an affair with Daniels. 2:10 p. m.  – Cohen describes plans to have Trump visit Russia during campaignMichael Cohen described negotiations he said he conducted with Trump campaign manager Cory Lewandowski “early on in the campaign” to have Trump visit Russia to “take a look” at the Trump Tower in Moscow project. Cohen and Lewandowski discussed the “possibility of which dates that Mr.  Trump would have availability if, in fact, that we were going to go over to Russia to take a look at the project. ”In November, Cohen pleaded guilty to lying to Congress about whether Trump and his company had pursued the Moscow real estate project while Trump was securing the GOP nomination in 2016. Cohen said the visit “never came to fruition because we were never successful in getting … ownership or control over a piece of property. ”1:45 p. m.  – Cohen contradicts Steele dossier, says he has never been to PragueMichael Cohen insisted under oath on Wednesday that he has never been to Prague or the Czech Republic, a central allegation in the dossier former MI-6 agent Christopher Steele compiled as opposition research. The dossier describes an incident in August 2016 in which Cohen allegedly traveled to Prague to meet with Russians.  Buzzfeed News posted the dossier in January 2017. Cohen has denied this claim in the past, including during an interview with ABC News. “I’ve never actually walked the land in Prague,” Cohen told ABC News.  “And last August I was not in Prague. ”1:25 p. m.  – Cohen says Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner’s attorney ‘reviewed’ his letter to Congress, tooAbbe Lowell, the attorney who represents the president's daughter and son-in-law, Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner, also reviewed Michael Cohen’s letter to Congress in 2017 that ultimately became the basis for charges Cohen lied to Congress, Cohen said Wednesday. They were not immediately available for comment. Cohen said earlier that Jay Sekulow, one of President Trump’s lawyers, made changes and additions to Cohen's statement, and mentioned that others may have, too. Late Wednesday afternoon, Sekulow issued a statement saying, “Today’s testimony by Michael Cohen that attorneys for the President edited or changed his statement to Congress to alter the duration of the Trump Tower Moscow negotiations is completely false. \\\"In his opening statement on Wednesday, Cohen said one of “Mr.  Trump’s personal lawyers reviewed and edited my statement to Congress about the timing of the Moscow Tower negotiations before I gave it. ”Cohen pleaded guilty in November to lying to Congress about whether Trump and his company had pursued the Moscow real estate project while Trump was securing the GOP nomination in 2016. 1:20 p. m.  – Cohen says Trump called him to coordinate messaging -- effectively lie -- about whether he knew about hush money paymentsMichael Cohen said during testimony on Wednesday that President Trump sought to coordinate public messaging about hush money payments to Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal in February 2018.  The women claim to have had affairs with Trump that he has denied. Trump instructed Cohen to say “he was not knowledgeable of the reimbursements and he wasn't knowledgeable of my actions,” Cohen said, referring to the hush money payments. Trump publicly denied knowledge of the payments before his attorney, Rudy Giuliani, confirmed later – in May 2018 – that Trump reimbursed Cohen for the $130,000 payment to Daniels. 1:00 p. m.  – Cohen says Trump lawyer Jay Sekulow made changes to his false statement to CongressMichael Cohen said one of President Trump’s lawyers, Jay Sekulow, made changes and additions to Cohen's statement to Congress in 2017 that ultimately became the basis for charges Cohen lied to Congress. In his opening statement on Wednesday, Cohen said one of “Mr.  Trump’s personal lawyers reviewed and edited my statement to Congress about the timing of the Moscow Tower negotiations before I gave it. ”He later identified that lawyer as Sekulow, who he said made “several changes … including how we were going to handle that message which was … the message, of course, being the length of time that the Trump Tower Moscow project stayed and remained alive. ”Sekulow has not addressed Cohen's claim. Cohen pleaded guilty in November to lying to Congress about whether Trump and his company had pursued the Moscow real estate project while Trump was securing the GOP nomination in 2016. 12:40 p. m.  – Cohen: Aware of another 'illegal act' Trump has committed, says SDNY investigatingMichael Cohen teased another “wrongdoing or illegal act” he claimed President Trump has committed, but said he could not give details because of an ongoing investigation headed by federal prosecutors in the Southern District of New York. Asked by Rep.  Raja Krishnamoorthi, D-Ill. , whether there is “any other wrongdoing or illegal act that you are aware of regarding Donald Trump that we haven't yet discussed today,” Cohen replied he was aware. “Yes,” he said, “and again, those are part of the investigation that's currently being looked at by the Southern District of New York. ”Cohen added that he is in “constant contact with the Southern District of New York regarding ongoing investigations. ”Outside the hearing room, SDNY had no comment. 12:30 p. m.  – Cohen to GOP: ‘Not one question so far has been about Mr.  Trump’In response to questions from Rep.  Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, Cohen called out Republicans on the panel for asking only about him and not President Trump. “I just find it interesting, sir, that between yourself and your colleagues, not one question so far since I'm here has been asked about President Trump,” Cohen said.  “That's actually why I thought I was coming today – not to confess the mistakes that I've made.  I've already done that. “The American people don't care about my taxes,” Cohen said.  “They want to know what it is that I know about Mr.  Trump, and not one question so far has been asked about Mr.  Trump. \\\"12:10 p. m.  – Cohen describes 'several factors' that led him to turn on TrumpAsked what caused him to turn on his longtime boss and effectively testify against him, Michael Cohen dramatically ticked off a list of Trump's actions and statements that led him to speak out. “Helsinki, Charlottesville, watching the daily destruction of our civility to one another, putting up with silly things like this,” Cohen said.  “It’s really unbecoming of Congress. ”Cohen said he used to protect Trump the way Republican members of the House Oversight Committee are protecting the president at Wednesday’s hearing. “I'm responsible for your silliness because I did the same thing that you're doing now for ten years,” Cohen said.  “I protected Mr.  Trump for ten years … I can only warn people the more people that follow Mr.  Trump, as I did blindly, are going to suffer the same consequences that I'm suffering. ”12:02 p. m.  – Cohen rejects accusation he’s trying to get a reduction in sentenceMichael Cohen denied a claim that his appearance is part of an effort to earn a reduction in his prison sentence. Asked by Rep.  Paul Gosar, R-Ariz. , whether his testimony could result in a reduction in his three-year sentence, Cohen said “it’s a possibility,” but rejected the notion that it is his purpose for testifying publicly before the House Oversight Committee. “I'm not sure how my appearance here today is providing substantial information that the Southern District can use for the creation of a case,” Cohen said, before joking, “Now if there is something that this group can do for me, I would gladly welcome it. ”Cohen is scheduled to report to prison on May 6. 12:00 p. m.  – Cohen describes Trump’s involvement in Trump Tower Moscow projectShortly before Michael Cohen asked for a break, he described what he said was the extent of Trump’s involvement in the Trump Tower Moscow negotiations during the campaign. “After each communication that I had [about the Trump Tower Moscow project], I would report back to [Trump] and our goal was to get this project,” Cohen said.  “We were interested in building what would have been the largest building in all of Europe. ”In his opening statement, Cohen said Trump remained directly involved in negotiations and often asked Cohen, “How’s it going in Russia? ”In November, Cohen pleaded guilty to lying to Congress about whether Trump and his company had pursued a Moscow real estate project while he was securing the GOP nomination in 2016. 11:45 a. m.  – Cohen pressed on his claim Trump is 'a racist'Rep.  Mark Meadows, R-N. C. , invited a guest to appear during his questioning of Cohen. Lynne Patton, a current Department of Housing and Urban Development official and former longtime Trump Organization employee, stood behind Meadows as he questioned Cohen about his allegation that Trump is “a racist. ”Meadows put a statement from Patton defending Trump into the record and asked Cohen to reconcile his claim with her defense of Trump as an African-American woman and the daughter of a man who grew up in Birmingham, Alabama. Cohen shot back by pointing out that he stands by his testimony as the son of a Holocaust survivor, prompting audible \\\"oohs\\\" from onlookers inside the hearing room. 11:30 a. m.  – Cohen hits back: 'Shame on you, Mr.  Jordan'Cohen, who once called himself Donald Trump’s “attack dog,” unleashed a heated rebuke of the ranking Republican on the committee, Rep.  Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, during a debate over whether Cohen accepted his guilt. Jordan read a quote the December indictment of Cohen written by federal prosecutors in the Southern District of New York.  It said Cohen’s “consciousness of wrongdoing is fleeting, his instinct to blame others is strong,” and accused Cohen of failing to appropriately show remorse for his actions. Cohen took issue with that characterization. “Shame on you, Mr.  Jordan,” Cohen said.  “That's not what I said.  What I said is, I took responsibility and I take responsibility … I am remorseful and I am going to prison. \\\"Cohen is scheduled to report to prison on May 6 to serve a three-year sentence. 11:12 a. m.  – Cohen says Trump and his children were ‘compromised’ by RussiaDuring a line of questioning about WikiLeaks’ release of internal Democrat National Committee and Hillary Clinton campaign emails, Cohen said he believes President Trump and his children may have been “conflicted or compromised” by Russia during the 2016 presidential campaign. He stopped short of characterizing the campaign’s alleged knowledge of the impending release of hacked Democrats’ emails as “collusion,” but said there was “something odd. ”\\\"As I stated in my testimony, I wouldn't use the word colluding,\\\" Cohen said.  Was there something odd about the back and forth praise with President Putin?  Yes.  But I'm not really sure that I can answer that question in terms of collusion. \\\"In his opening statement, Cohen claimed that Trump, as a candidate, knew his longtime political confidant Roger Stone was talking with Julian Assange about WikiLeaks' revealing of emails from prominent Democrats. 11:05 a. m.  – Cohen denies any desire to work in the White HouseRep.  Jim Jordan of Ohio, the ranking Republican on the committee and first to question Cohen, accused Cohen of acting in defiance of President Trump because he was upset at not getting a position in the White House after Trump’s election. Cohen categorically denied the allegation. “Mr.  Jordan, all I wanted was what I got, to be personal attorney to the president,” Cohen said. Cohen described an incident in which Trump \\\"reamed out\\\" former White House chief of staff Reince Priebus because Cohen hadn't gotten a job in the White House Counsel's office. 10:55 a. m.  – Questioning begins with an inquiry into hush money paymentsAfter Cohen’s 30-minute opening statement, the questioning portion of Wednesday’s hearing is underway. Rep.  Cummings, as committee chairman, began with a line of questioning about the hush money payments Cohen made to adult film actress Stormy Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, and his reimbursement by Trump. “The president said he knew nothing of these favors,” Cummings said.  “Based on your conversations with him, is there any doubt in your mind that President Trump knew exactly what he was paying for? ”“There is no doubt in my mind and I truly believe there is no doubt in the people of the United States of America,” Cohen said. Cohen presented a copy of a check Trump allegedly wrote, after taking office, to reimburse Cohen for the hush-money payment. Outside the hearing room, the Trump Organization responded that Donald Trump Jr.  had \\\"no concept/idea\\\" that he was signing a check to reimburse Cohen for the Stormy Daniels hush money payment.  Donald Trump Jr.  signed the $35,000 check as a trustee of the Donald J.  Trump Revocable Trust. President Trump has denied having an affair with Daniels. 10:42 a. m.  – Michael Cohen shares regrets, shame for a decade of work for Trump“And yet I continued working for him. ”That’s the refrain Michael Cohen is repeating after each damning anecdote he offers about President Trump.  Cohen’s opening statement included repeated mentions of how \\\"ashamed\\\" he feels now about his work for Trump. “I am ashamed because I know what Mr.  Trump is,” Cohen said. Cohen described with remorse the threatening letters he wrote on Trump’s behalf and the bidding he did for a man he called “a racist,” “a conman,” and “a cheat. ”“I am not a perfect man,” Cohen said.  “I have done things I am not proud of, and I will live with the consequences of my actions for the rest of my life. ”10:30 a. m.  – Cohen paints damning picture of Trump in opening statementMichael Cohen tore into President Trump’s character and business acumen in a scathing opening statement, calling him \\\"a racist,\\\" \\\"a con man\\\" and \\\"a cheat. \\\"ABC News reported details of Cohen’s intended testimony earlier on Wednesday. Cohen divulged that Trump, as a candidate, knew Roger Stone was talking with Julian Assange about WikiLeaks' revealing of emails from the Democratic National Committee. 10:25 a. m.  – Cohen sworn in, gives opening statementMichael Cohen began his opening statement after rising, raising his right hand, and being sworn in. \\\"Chairman Cummings, Ranking Member Jordan, and Members of the Committee, thank you for inviting me here today,” Cohen said.  “I am here under oath to correct the record, to answer the Committee’s questions truthfully, and to offer the American people what I know about President Trump. ”10:18 a. m.  – Ranking Republican slams Cohen, Democrats in opening statementThe ranking Republican on the Oversight Committee launched an early attack on Michael Cohen’s credibility and Democrats’ willingness to hear the former fixer’s testimony on Wednesday. “The first announced witness for the 116th Congress is a guy who is going to prison in two months for lying to Congress,” Rep.  Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, said in his opening comments. Jordan criticized Cummings for offering “a convicted felon a forum to tell stories and lie about the president of the United States so they can all start their impeachment process. ”“They just want to use you, Mr.  Cohen,” Jordan said.  “You're their patsy today. ”10:12 a. m.  – Chairman Rep.  Cummings warns Cohen not to lieIn his opening statement, the committee’s chairman, Rep.  Elijah Cummings, warned Cohen against lying to his panel. “I have made it abundantly clear to Mr.  Cohen that if he comes here today and he does not tell us the truth, I will be the first one to refer those untruthful statements to DOJ (the Department of Justice),” Cummings said. Cohen pleaded guilty to lying to Congress in December – charges brought by special counsel Robert Mueller. Cummings added that its hearing today and moving forward reflect a new era of Democratic oversight. “The days of this committee protecting the president at all costs are over,” he said. 10:07 a. m.  – Republicans move to postpone Cohen’s hearingA top Republican leveled an early effort to stop Cohen’s testimony, demanding the hearing be delayed. Rep.  Mark Meadows, R-N. C. , raised a procedural tactic to delay the hearing, citing the short notice of the committee’s receipt of Cohen’s testimony and evidence he plans to present. The committee voted down Rep.  Meadows’ point of order and the hearing continued. 10 a. m.  Cohen takes witness chair, hearing beginsMichael Cohen entered the committee at 10 a. m on the dot and took the witness chair for what promised to be dramatic testimony about his former boss Donald Trump before the House Oversight Committee.  The panel's chairman, Rep.  Elijah Cummings, D-Md. , gaveled in the hearing shortly thereafter. The man who once said he would take a bullet for Donald Trump is poised to excoriate his longtime former boss with more than a decade of anecdotes. In his opening statement, Cohen is expected to characterize Trump as a “racist” and a “conman. ”9:55 a. m.  Committee members gathering inside hearing roomMembers of the House Oversight Committee are gathering in the committee’s hearing room with just minutes until Michael Cohen is expected to take his seat. Democrats met this morning in committee chambers before congregating in the hearing room.  Republicans on the panel have set up large posters with Cohen’s past comments flattering the president. Cohen had no comment as he arrived on Capitol Hill.  As he left his hotel Wednesday morning, staff and hotel guests greeted and wished him well, some hugging him and people saying “God bless you. ”“I’m going to do the right thing,” Cohen said.  He also called it “the craziest day” of his life. Cohen, who spent a decade at Trump's side at the Trump Organization, will testify before House lawmakers at 10 a. m.  Wednesday as President Trump wraps up his first day of meetings with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Vietnam. Cohen is scheduled to begin a three-year prison sentence in May and has pleaded guilty to lying to Congress as well as financial crimes including bank and tax fraud.  Cohen also pleaded guilty to campaign finance violation for payments made to adult film star Stormy Daniels during the 2016 presidential campaign. The White House, along with Republicans on Capitol Hill, sought to discredit Cohen ahead of his appearance. \\\"Disgraced felon Michael Cohen is going to prison for lying to Congress and making other false statements,\\\" White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said Tuesday in a statement.  \\\"Sadly, he will go before Congress this week and we can expect more of the same.  It's laughable that anyone would take a convicted liar like Cohen at his word, and pathetic to see him given yet another opportunity to spread his lies. \\\"Rep.  Matt Gaetz, R-Fla. , a staunch Trump ally, also tweeted Tuesday that the hearing could reveal alleged details about Cohen's romantic life, prompting outrage from Democrats and ethics experts. The stakes were also high for Democrats in the House, who have vowed to investigate the president and conduct oversight of the administration amid accusations of overreach from Republicans. House Oversight Committee Chairman Elijah Cummings, D-Md. , suggested the hearing \\\"may very well be a turning point in our country's history. \\\"\\\"He's the only person that I know of who has accused this president of a crime,\\\" he told reporters on Monday. Cohen was prepared to provide lawmakers with documents to support his claims that Trump allegedly inflated and deflated his net worth for personal and professional gain, and to avoid paying property taxes, according to a source familiar with his intended testimony. The president's former fixer was also expected to explain why he lied to Congress in 2017 about discussions he had during the presidential campaign about the proposed Trump Tower Moscow. His specific allegation of criminal wrongdoing relates to Trump's reimbursement to Cohen for the payment to adult film actress and director Stormy Daniels, who alleged an affair with Trump, according to the source familiar with Cohen's planned testimony. Trump has denied the affair alleged by Daniels and another accusation from former Playboy model Karen McDougal and has previously said the payment amounted to nothing more than a \\\"simple private transaction,\\\" and that they do not qualify as campaign finance violations. Cohen appeared before the House Oversight and Reform Committee after postponing an initial hearing date, citing \\\"threats\\\" to his family by Trump and his lawyer Rudy Giuliani. On Tuesday he spent hours behind closed doors with the Senate Intelligence Committee and will meet with the House Intelligence Committee in private on Thursday. \\\"Two years ago when this investigation started, I said it may be the most important thing I'm involved in my public life in the Senate,\\\" Sen.  Mark Warner, D-Va. , the top Democrat on the panel, told reporters after the panel questioned Cohen.  \\\"Nothing I have heard today dissuades me from that view. \\\"\\\"We will call out the Democrats' charade for what it is -- a partisan circus meant to destroy President Trump,\\\" Reps.  Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, and Mark Meadows, R-N. C. , said in a USA Today editorial. At Cohen's sentencing hearing in December, special counsel Robert Mueller's team said Cohen had cooperated with their investigation. Ahead of the House hearing, during his day with the Senate Intelligence Committee, Cohen was officially disbarred as a lawyer in New York, according to a decision from the Appellate Division of the New York State Supreme Court expected after his November guilty plea.

'Alleged synagogue gunman linked to mosque fireAt the age of 8, Noya Dahan has already fled rocket attacks in Israel, witnessed her home in California vandalized with anti-Semitic graffiti and, now, she's survived a shooting at her synagogue that left one beloved member dead and she, her rabbi and her uncle with bullet wounds. The youngest victim of Saturday's shooting at the Chabad of Poway synagogue near San Diego, Noya told ABC News that the safety of the one place she used to feel secure in, a synagogue, has been shattered. \\\"I never thought that was going to happen to me because like it's a safe place, you're supposed to feel safe,\\\" she said. A day after an alleged 19-year-old gunman, identified by police as John Earnest, opened fire inside the synagogue, turning a Passover service into what Noya's father described as \\\"like a war,\\\" survivors spoke out, offering details on the bullets, blood and chaos they witnessed in the latest gun rampage in America. Noya was hit in the face, near her right cheek and in her right leg by bullet fragments during the attack.  She said she will never forget how loud the gunshots were or seeing her rabbi, Yisroel Goldstein, bleeding profusely from both hands after being shot by the gunman. \\\"I saw the rabbi jumping like crazy, and I couldn't even imagine. . . ,\\\" Noya said.  \\\"I felt like I was in a movie or in a dream or something. \\\"Rabbi Goldstein, who founded the synagogue 33 years ago with his wife, said he was just getting prepared to deliver his Passover sermon at about 11:30 a. m.  when he went out into the lobby and ran into one of the temple's members, Lori Kaye, 60. I was centimeters from death\\\"She's been a member with us since the '90s.  She's one of the most kindest persons, an activist, who's always there to help others, to help the world.  That was her mission in life, just to be out, to do kindness and goodness,\\\" Goldstein told ABC News on Sunday. He said Kaye was at the service with her husband, Dr.  Howard Kaye, and their 22-year-old daughter, Hannah. \\\"She asked me what time Yizkor was,\\\" he said of a special pray for the departed.  \\\"Her mother just recently died and she came to memorialize her. \\\"He said he went to his office to freshen up, and when he came back Kaye had confirmed on her own the time for the Yizkor prayer service. \\\"We both looked and smiled at each other,\\\" the rabbi said.  \\\"I turned around to walk into the banquet hall, where I was going to wash my hands, and I heard the first loud noise. \\\"At first he didn't know if Kaye had fallen or if a table had toppled over. \\\"I turned around and I see the shooter standing there in position with a rifle moving it towards me,\\\" Goldstein said. He said he put both his hands in front of his face in an effort to protect himself.  A bullet severed the index finger of his right hand, and another nearly did the same to his left index finger, he said. He saw Kaye, mortally wounded, lying on the floor.  Bullets continued to fly by on either side of him, he said. \\\"I was centimeters from death,\\\" Goldstein said.  \\\"I turn my back towards him and he's shooting bullets towards me, trying to get me down in the banquet hall. \\\"He said he saw a group of children in the banquet hall, including his grandchildren and Noya and he immediately began to gather them up to get them out of harm's way. Noya's uncle, Almog Peretz, 34, who lives in Israel but is in California on vacation, told ABC News that he was walking from the banquet hall when he heard the shots and saw the gunman. \\\"I turn around and I saw him and the gun, the big gun.  He looks at me and he shoots one after one,\\\" he said. He said he picked up a 5-year-old girl walking next to him, lifted another child in his arms and began to direct up to 20 children out a side door, directing them to the rabbi's house next door. He said he didn't realize he had been shot in the back of the right leg until a relative noticed that the back of his pant leg was full of blood. His brother-in-law, Noya's father, Israel Dahan, said he was frantically searching for his three children.  He said he initially feared one of his girls who had been in the restroom was dead and sent his brother-in-law in to find her. Israel Dahan, who moved his family to California to get away from the danger of rocket attacks on their former home in Israel, said his daughter was frantic, but alive. Rabbi Goldstein, who received a phone call from President Donald Trump while speaking with ABC News, said a U. S.  Border Patrol agent named Jonathan, who had become a member of his congregation and another member named Oscar Stewart, a former military soldier, confronted the gunman. \\\"One of the miracles that happened here was that the rifle got jammed,\\\" he said of the gunman's weapon. He said Oscar and Jonathan chased the gunman out of the synagogue.  He said Jonathan, the Border Patrol agent, picked up a gun apparently dropped by another member of the congregation, and fired at the suspect, hitting his car as he drove off. A police K-9 officer saw the gunman nearby, officials said.  The suspect jumped out of his car, put his hands up and was arrested, San Diego Police Chief David Nisleit said during the conference on Saturday. I really don't feel safe because this is not the first and definitely not the last time this is going to happenRabbi Goldstein said that once the shooter fled the synagogue he went back inside and saw Lori Kaye lying unconscious on the floor.  He said her husband entered the lobby and fainted. Initially refusing medical attention, Goldstein, his bleeding hands wrapped in a pray cloth, addressed his terrified flock. \\\"I saw the sight of fear, of anger and despair on my fellow Jews. . . , I got up on the chair and I said, 'Guys, Am Yisrael Chai,'\\\" he said reciting the Hebrew phrase for 'the people of Israel live. '\\\"'We are alive,'\\\" he said he told the worshipers.  \\\"'We need to stand tall.  We need to be proud of our heritage and do not allow any of this terrorism to tear us down. \\\"Since the shooting, he has asked himself why he survived. \\\"What do I do with this?  What do I do with my survival?  I think there is a message that I need to share with everyone,\\\" he said.  \\\"And we've got to get the message out there: People need to be aware that anti-Semitism is a reality.  It's happening now just like it was happening prior to the holocaust.  This is how the holocaust started and we have to get up and stop it. \\\"For young Noya, whose home was vandalized with anti-Semitic graffiti four years ago, life has changed forever. \\\"I just kept on dreaming about it.  I just couldn't . . .  dream about something good.  I just dreamt about the bad things,\\\" she told ABC News.  \\\"I really don't feel safe because this is not the first and definitely not the last time this is going to happen.

Of the Sensex constituents, 21 closed in the red and only nine in the green.  Among the gainers were Axis Bank, Sun Pharma, Bajaj Auto, Bajaj FinServ, HDFC Bank and Dr Reddy’s.

On the other hand, Grasim was in focus on Monday as it jumped 6. 44 per cent after it announced its foray into paints business. Analysts said that corporate earnings so far have been quite impressive as earnings exceeded analysts’ estimates in most of the companies.  Further, vaccination drive started well in India, which along with continued improvement in recovery rate offers domestic equities an edge over other markets.

Trump: 'We can never let this happen to another president again'In his first remarks on special counsel Robert Mueller since his report was turned in Friday, President Donald Trump on Monday offered an opinion in sharp contrast to the past two years of insults he's hurled at both the special counsel and his investigation. \\\"Do you think Robert Mueller acted honorably? ” ABC News Chief White House Correspondent Jon Karl asked the president during an event with Israeli Prime Minister Benyamin Netanyahu.  \\\"Yes, he did,\\\" Trump responded.  Trump has previously described Mueller as “conflicted,” “disgraced” and a “liar. ”Asked at an Oval Office photo-op a few minutes later if he still believed the investigation was a witch hunt, Trump said it ended the way it should have but went on for far too long.  Trump added that no other president should have to face an investigation like it ever again. \\\"It's 100 percent the way it should have been.  I wish it could have gone a lot sooner, a lot quicker.  There are a lot of people out there that have done some very, very evil things, very bad things, I would say treasonous things against our country,\\\" Trump said.  \\\"Those people will certainly be looked at.  I've been looking at them for a long time and I'm saying 'why haven't they been looked at? ' Congress, many of them you know who they are.  They've done so many evil things,\\\" Trump said. \\\"I will tell you I love this country.  I love this country as much as I can anything -- my family, my country, my God, but what they did was a false narrative.  It was a terrible thing.  We can never let this happen to another president again.  I can tell you that.  Very few people I know could have handled it.  We can never, ever let this happen to another president again. \\\"Trump also reiterated his view Attorney General William Barr should decide whether to make the full report becomes public. \\\"Up to the attorney general, wouldn't bother me at all,\\\" Trump said, referring to a public release.  Trump also said he isn't thinking about pardoning anyone sentenced during the probe. The summary of the report, submitted to Congress Sunday by Barr, said there was no evidence of collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russian government.  Mueller did not come to a conclusion on obstruction of justice, according to Barr's summary, so Barr took that on himself, concluding that the evidence Muller found didn't support a charge, although Barr didn't reveal all that Mueller discovered. Congressional Democrats continue to demand the full report from Mueller. Last week, the president told reporters at the White House, \\\"let it come out, let people see it. \\\"The president has claimed \\\"complete and total exoneration\\\" from the report, which White House press secretary Sarah Sanders insisted was justified despite Mueller stating, according to Barr, that his not making a decision on the question did not amount to an exoneration on the matter of obstruction. Sanders was asked on NBC Monday morning to acknowledge that it was incorrect to say the report is a full vindication for the president. \\\"Not at all.  It is,\\\" she said. \\\"It is a complete and total exoneration, and here's why, because the special counsel, they said they couldn't make a decision one way or the other.  The way the process works is then they leave that up to the attorney general.  The attorney general and the deputy attorney general went through and based their decision on Mueller's investigation.  This wasn't based on just their own ideas and their own thinking.  It was based on Mueller's investigation,\\\" Sanders said. Critics, however, rejected Trump's claims of exoneration -- and rejected the notion that Barr was objective in his summary. \\\"Given Mr.  Barr’s public record of bias against the Special Counsel’s inquiry, he is not a neutral observer and is not in a position to make objective determinations about the report,\\\" Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said in a statement over the weekend. Democratic Rep.  Jerry Nadler, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, criticized Barr's quick turnover of a summary on an investigation that took almost two years and said Barr is likely to be subpoenaed to explain his actions and conclusions. \\\"We will ask the attorney general to testify before the House Judiciary Committee.  We will demand the release of the full report.  The American people are entitled to a full accounting of the president's misconduct referenced by the special counsel,\\\" Nadler said at a press conference over the weekend in New York district. . In a tweet over the weekend, Nadler described \\\"very concerning discrepancies\\\" within the report and \\\"final decision making at the Justice Department. \\\" The report \\\"did not exonerate the President,\\\" Nadler tweeted. Former U. S.  attorney for the Southern District of New York, Preet Bharara, said that while the case on collusion \\\"is closed,\\\" on the issue of obstruction of justice, \\\"we're sort of not done. \\\"\\\"It seems to me it was a very close case.  Bob Mueller decided not to make a determination about whether or not a charge can be brought, and you only do that if there is substantial evidence of obstruction,\\\" Bharara said on ABC's \\\"Good Morning America\\\" Monday. While it's clear Congress will continue to investigate the questions around obstruction of justice, it remains to be seen whether the president will be receptive to those questions. Asked on \\\"Good Morning America\\\" if the president was prepared to cooperate with any continuing investigations in the House, one of the president's lawyers, Jay Sekulow, said it would be a waste of taxpayer money, listing off all of the evidence Mueller obtained in the probe that lasted the past 22 months. “I think the reality is that Congress is wasting the taxpayers' money, frankly, and they should be going about legislating and governing rather than continuing this that is a prerogative they have,” Sekulow said.  “I think at this point it’s ridiculous to put people through this. ”Trump went as far as to call the entire investigation an \\\"“illegal takedown that failed\\\" on Sunday.  Trump made the claim despite Mueller having been appointed as special counsel by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein after the president's own decision to fire then-FBI Director James Comey, who was leading an investigation into possible Trump campaign's ties to Russia.  Trump and congressional Republicans have claimed that there was wrongdoing in the way the investigation was carried out. Counselor to the president Kellyanne Conway aired those grievances Monday morning, sharing sharp criticism of those who \\\"let this lie fly for two years, hanging and harrassing and trying to embarass -- and worse -- those of us connected to the 2016 campaign. \\\" Those critics now owe Trump, his family and the country an apology, Conway said on Fox News. Conway specifically called out Rep.  Adam Schiff, a critic of the president and a Democrat who heads the House Intelligence Committee. \\\"He ought to resign today,\\\" Conway said.  \\\"He has been on every TV show 50 times a day for practically the last two years promising Americans that the president would either be impeached or indicted. \\\"Conway also previewed the way the administration will seek to use the Mueller report in the face of upcoming Congressional investigations, despite almost two years spent escalating attacks on the investigation and Mueller as biased and a witch hunt. \\\"Bob Mueller already ran the fair and the full investigation.  And any partisan, politicized investigation from here on in will never have the credibility of the Mueller investigation, and the credibility of Attorney General Barr and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein -- what they have done here,\\\" Conway said. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events\",\"document_ocr\":\"abc\\nNEWS\\n\",\"Category\":\"Insufficient_Text\"},{\"Id\":34898,\"claim_image\":\"http://pbs.twimg.com/media/E1VVVhNVoAIn4Hh.png?format=jpg&name=large\",\"claim\":\"Our Govt has decided to consider workers employed in Pharmaceuticals/medicine supply chain from production to retailing as frontline #COVID healthcare warriors.

SK Rungta, general secretary of the National Federation of the Blind, said, “Due to the increase in Covid-19 cases in the country, the general public is facing a lot of problems in getting tests done.  But the problem for people with disabilities has increased manifold.  A lot of labs are not doing home collection and then there are long queues for testing.  It is impossible for a blind person to go and stand in a queue.  Similarly, for vaccination and treatment, priority should be given to people with disabilities.  We have received several complaints from across the country about the problems disabled face for getting their Covid-19 tests done or vaccination. ”An official from the department of empowerment of persons with disabilities said that they have received similar representations from different organisations and activists from across the country. Rungta added, “We have written to both the health ministry and the department of empowerment of persons with disabilities.  We hope necessary directions are issued to state governments and union territories. ” Disability rights activist Abha Khetrapal, who recently tested positive for Covid-19, said it is very difficult for a person with a disability to manage if he or she tests positive.  “I had to wait for 24 hours before I could arrange for my sample to be collected from home.  In the present situation, the government should provide special helpline numbers for disabled people.

While the infection has been spreading, the number of patients recovering from the disease is inceasing. In 14 states, the number of recovered patients is more than those admitted to the hospital for Covid-19 treatment, according to data analysis doe by Hindustan Times’ Hindi language publication Hindustan. According to Union health ministry data quoted by Hindustan 48 per cent of those who contracted the disease have been cured.  The highest rate if recovery is in Punjab which has seen 86 per cent of its patients leaving the hospital competely recovered, according to the health ministry.  Out of 2,301 patients in the state, 2,000 have been cured.  Only 256 active cases are there in the state. Next in line is Uttar Pradesh.  Out of 8,075 patients, 4,843 have been discharged - a recovery rate of 60 per cent - and 3,015 are still in hospitals.  In Tamil Nadu, out of the total 23,495 cases, 13,170 have recovered whereas 10,141 are still in hospital.  The recovery rate here is just above 56 per cent. Giving details about some other states, the health ministry data said that Telangana has 1,491 recovered patients out of total 2,792 (and 1,213 are in hospitals), Andhra Pradesh has 2,378 cured patients out of a total of 3,783.  At least 1,341 patients are still in hospitals.  Similarly, in Chandigarh 199 patients out of 294 have been cured or discharged and only 91 remain in hospitals. The overall recovery rate in the country, now 48. 19 per cent, has improved from 11. 42 per cent on April 15 to 26. 59 per cent on May 3 and to 38. 29 per cent on May 18, the ministry said. The ministry also said that there has been a steady decline in India’s Covid-19 fatality rate which now stands at 2. 83 per cent, much lower than in countries like the US, the UK, France and Italy.  From 3. 3 per cent on April 15, it declined to 3. 25 per cent on May 3 and came down further to 3. 15 per cent on May 18, the ministry said. “A steady decline can be seen in the case fatality rate in the country.  The relatively low death rate is attributed to the continued focus on surveillance, timely case identification and clinical management of the cases,” the ministry said. “Two specific trends are thus noticed, while the recovery rate is increasing on one hand, case fatality is going down on the other,” it said. The ministry also said that the testing capacity has increased in the country through 472 government and 204 private laboratories. India is the seventh worst-hit nation by the Covid-19 pandemic in terms of the number of infections, after the US, Brazil, Russia, the UK, Spain and Italy. \",\"document_ocr\":\"COVID-19 BULLETIN - JHARKHAND\\njor\\nData as on 12.08.20 at 10.00 PM\\nरण सरकार\\n(I) Status of Sample Testing of Suspects & COVID-19 Cases\\nCumulative till\\nGrand\\nSr. No.\\nActivity\\nToday Status\\nYesterday\\nTotal\\nA) Sample Testing\\nTotal Number of Samples Collected\\n400980\\n7138\\n408118\\nTotal Number of Samples Tested\\n395800\\n6272\\n402072\\n3\\nNumber of Negative cases\\n376222\\n5593\\n381815\\n4\\nNumber of Positive cases\\n19578\\n679\\n20257\\nNumber of Cases declared Recovered & Discharged\\n10630\\n1567\\n12197\\n6\\nNumber of Death\\n194\\n202\\n7\\nTotal Active Cases\\n7858\\n(II) District wise breakup of All COVID-19 Cases\\nCumulative till Yesterday\\nToday status\\nTotal\\nRecovered & Total Deaths Positive\\nDischarged\\nSr. No.\\nDistrict\\nTotal\\nTotal\\nNo. of\\nRecovered &\\nActive\\nNew Positive\\nDeath\\nDischarged\\nCases\\nCases\\nCases\\nBokaro\\n162\\n324\\n2\\n488\\n35\\n27\\n2\\nChatra\\n187\\n263\\n1\\n451\\n63\\nDeoghar\\nDhanbad\\n3\\n217\\n438\\n660\\n53\\n63\\n4\\n551\\n639\\n19\\n1209\\n41\\n274\\n5\\nDumka\\n98\\n101\\n199\\n6\\n16\\n6.\\nEast Singhbhum\\n1994\\n1115\\n73\\n3182\\n177\\n111\\n5\\nGarhwa\\n195\\n475\\n4\\n674\\n10\\n21\\n8.\\nGiridih\\n104\\n944\\n1054\\n12\\n10\\n9.\\nGodda\\n325\\n260\\n3\\n588\\n12\\n285\\n10\\nGumla\\n185\\n276\\n1\\n462\\n15\\n52\\n11\\nHazaribagh\\n331\\n573\\n13\\n917\\n10\\n27\\n1\\n12\\nJamtara\\n62\\n102\\n164\\n15\\n13\\nKhunti\\n281\\n75\\n2\\n358\\n12\\n14\\nKoderma\\n314\\n428\\n6\\n748\\n11\\n15\\nLatehar\\n183\\n271\\n454\\n26\\n51\\n16\\nLohardaga\\n83\\n227\\n2\\n312\\n12\\n25\\n17\\nPakur\\n116\\n211\\n327\\n90\\n18\\nPalamu\\n415\\n453\\n3\\n871\\n5\\n40\\n19 Ramgarh\\n170\\n449\\n623\\n5\\n21\\n4\\n20\\nRanchi\\n1921\\n1845\\n33\\n3799\\n119\\n156\\n1\\nSahebganj\\nSaraikela\\n21\\n223\\n124\\n352\\n9\\n53\\n22\\n272\\n165\\n4\\n441\\n36\\n57\\nSimdega\\nWest Singhbhum\\n23\\n149\\n515\\n2\\n666\\n34\\n10\\n24\\n216\\n357\\n6\\n579\\n31\\n88\\nTotal\\n8754\\n10630\\n194\\n19578\\n679\\n1567\\n8\\n(III) Other Indicators\\nIndicators\\nIndia\\nJharkhand\\n7 days Growth Rate\\n7 days Doubling Rate\\nRecovery Rate\\nMortality Rate\\n2.96%\\n5.34%\\n13.31 days\\n60.21%\\n24.02 days\\n3\\n69.34%\\n4\\n2.00%\\n0.99%\\n\",\"Category\":\"Insufficient_Text\"},{\"Id\":34905,\"claim_image\":\"http://pbs.twimg.com/media/ErIDpCXVoAEdN_x.jpg?format=jpg&name=large\",\"claim\":\"Congress and Left hold a joint meeting in Kolkata to discuss seat-sharing for the West Bengal Legislative Assembly elections. https://t.co/IRD6OAm6wT\",\"claim_ocr\":\"ANI\\n\",\"document_image\":\"http://pbs.twimg.com/media/E2N8HG0VoAQ-Fwp.jpg?format=jpg&name=large\",\"document\":\"The Supreme Court on Tuesday issued a notice to the West Bengal government on a plea seeking humanitarian relief for people displaced due to the alleged violence in the state which took place after results of the assembly elections were announced earlier this month.

The first of the fires erupted on Tuesday just before midnight.  Police said that “it appears an individual entered the sanctuary area of the church and intentionally started the fire. ”Although the fire had already burned itself out by the time firefighters arrived, heavy smoke could be seen emanating from the building and firefighters had to vent the building to allow the smoke to escape.  There were no injuries reported and the damage appeared to be due mostly to smoke, soot and heat. Elizabeth Collado, the church minister’s daughter, told ABC Philadelphia station WPVI on Wednesday that the church “never had any problems with anybody around here. ”“You know, it makes us cry,” she continued.  “We were talking about homelessness before.  This feels like homelessness.  Where do we go to worship?  This is our house of worship. ”The second fire occurred around 2 a. m.  Thursday morning.  Police said that the fire was extinguished quickly and that it was contained to the roof of the building, where officials said it appeared someone had climbed up and ignited an accelerant. Torres was arrested Friday in Allentown and arraigned on criminal charges Friday night, police said.

The schoolgirl said her family approached the police on July 20 after the accused uploaded the video of the crime on social media.  The victim’s mother said the family went to the Hiranagar police station but the officials didn’t register a case. They then approached a local court on July 21. “We then went to a court in Hiranagar, which directed the women’s police cell to lodge an FIR (First Information Report ) and investigate the case,” the victim’s mother said. A senior police officer said acting upon the court orders, Kathua Police registered a case under sections 376, 109 and 67 of the Ranbir Penal Code, those of information technology act and the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act against the two accused identified as Vishal and Aman.  Both the men belong to Doonga village in Hiranagar. “We will arrest them soon,” he added. The schoolgirl said she was raped inside the Roohi Resorts at Kootah Morh on Jammu-Pathankot highway in May and that Vishal had filmed the crime on his mobile phone.  She said she had gone to the resort with a friend.  “Vishal pushed me into a room and took out a dagger.  He also slapped me and asked me to have sexual relations.  When I refused, he raped me.  He also shot a video of mine and threatened me to circulate it on social media, if I dared to tell the incident to anyone,” the girl, who had her face covered, said while speaking to reporters on Thursday in Kathua. The mother also said the families of both the accused had offered them money to them to take back their case and sort out the matter. “The family of the rapist has also offered a marriage proposal.  How sick on their part?  I want justice for my daughter,” she said. The accused are the victim’s classmates and were appearing as private students for the higher secondary examination in government higher secondary school in Kootah. Kathua has been in the news after the brutal gangrape and murder of an eight-year-old nomadic girl inside a temple in January last year.  The girl was kidnapped on January 10 and her body was found on January 17. A local court in Pathankot had on June 10 this year sentenced the temple’s priest Sanji Ram, dismissed special police officer Deepak Khajuria and Parvesh Kumar to life imprisonment while sacked policemen Anand Dutta, Tilak Raj and Surender Verma were handed five years in jail. \",\"document_ocr\":\"no.\\nENOUGH\\nIS\\nENOUGH\\n\",\"Category\":\"Insufficient_Text\"},{\"Id\":34910,\"claim_image\":\"http://pbs.twimg.com/media/EwGdIj3U8AIbbn3.jpg?format=jpg&name=large\",\"claim\":\"With Mallikarjun Kharge, Rahul Gandhi’s control over Congress' parliamentary wings is complete\\n\\n(reports @SaubhadraC)\\n\\nhttps://t.co/GTvyEwI0QU https://t.co/Mamkbj9KK1\",\"claim_ocr\":\"\",\"document_image\":\"http://pbs.twimg.com/media/EuWO1GmXYAA0Ws7.jpg?format=jpg&name=large\",\"document\":\"Former Union minister Mallikarjun Kharge’s appointment as the Leader of the Opposition in Rajya Sabha will deepen Rahul Gandhi’s influence over his party’s parliamentary wings, Congress leaders said.

A proposal to appoint former Union minister Manish Tewari as the Congress floor leader in the lower House received a lukewarm response from the top leadership and instead Chowdhury was appointed as the leader in 2019.  “Rahul Gandhi’s equation with Manish Tewari had soured in the last few years after the latter did not fight the Lok Sabha polls in 2014,” said a Congress leader considered close to Gandhi, requesting anonymity. Also Read | Help raise voice of the weak: Rahul to cadresPersonal equations have played a role, but Kharge and Chowdhury are also seen to be more aggressive, party leaders said. Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha proceedings have been disrupted this week over spiralling fuel prices.  On Wednesday, the Rajya Sabha failed to transact business due to Congress-led protests in the Upper House over fuel prices and farm laws. Congress leaders said protests and disruptions will be more frequent as Kharge-led party in the House was unlikely to take a softer line and take the BJP head-on in sync with Gandhi’s approach. The Congress has rejected the presiding officer’s suggestion to discuss the oil price issue during the debates on demand for grants and finance bill. In the first part of the ongoing budget session, when Ghulam Nabi Azad led the Congress in Rajya Sabha, the party agreed to join the discussions after a few days of protests even as its Lok Sabha wing continued its protests over the farm laws. Gandhi is believed to have been miffed with the party’s approach in Rajya Sabha and praised the Lok Sabha unit for its continued protests. Prime Minister Narendra Modi highlighted this division to attack the party and said, in his reply to the President’s debate, that a “confused and divided” Congress cannot be any good to the nation.  Later, in an interview with HT, Azad rejected Modi comments.  “It was a decision by all Opposition parties to stop protests and join the discussions,” Azad said. A Congress strategist said with Kharge in charge and deputy leader Anand Sharma almost sidelined in the party’s strategy making, such division for the Congress is unlikely to happen anymore.  “Kharge and Chowdhury—both Gandhi loyalists—in charge of the party will adopt a more coordinated approach in sync with Congress high command’s directions,” the strategist said on condition of anonymity. \",\"document_ocr\":\"ANI\\n\",\"Category\":\"Insufficient_Text\"},{\"Id\":34911,\"claim_image\":\"http://pbs.twimg.com/media/EvtJndLVgAI6wJb.png?format=jpg&name=large\",\"claim\":\"Tamil Nadu: Congress MP Karti P Chidambaram has filed an application before the party's state election committee  requesting that Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra be named as the candidate for the by-polls to Kanyakumari Lok Sabha constituency https://t.co/BVegDsF9fQ\",\"claim_ocr\":\"TAN DU\\nESS\\n\",\"document_image\":\"http://pbs.twimg.com/media/Evtc6VsU8AAOF9a.jpg?format=jpg&name=large\",\"document\":\"Congress leader Karti Chidambaram has filed an application before the party's state election committee, requesting that Priyanka Gandhi Vadra should be named as candidate for the by-polls to Kanyakumari Lok Sabha constituency.

Chief Metropolitan Magistrate Gurmohina Kaur granted the relief to the foreigners on furnishing a personal bond of Rs 10,000 each. Till date, 445 foreign nationals from 33 different countries, who were charge-sheeted in the case have been granted bail by the court. The police had in June filed 59 charge sheets, including supplementaries, against 956 foreigners belonging to 36 different countries in the case. The accused who were granted bail Saturday will file their plea bargaining applications on Monday, said advocates Ashima Mandla, Mandakini Singh and Fahim Khan, appearing for them.   Under plea bargaining, the accused plead guilty to the offence, praying for a lesser punishment.  The Criminal Procedure Code allows for plea bargaining in cases where the maximum punishment is a seven-year imprisonment; offences don’t affect the socio-economic conditions of the society and the offence is not committed against a woman or a child below 14 years of age. During the hearing, all the foreigners were produced before the court through video conferencing. The court had granted bail to 122 Malaysians on Tuesday and 91 other foreigners from 21 countries on Wednesday, 76 foreign nationals from eight countries on Thursday and 82 Bangaldeshi nationals on Friday.   The investigating officer had earlier told the court that the investigation was completed against the 956 foreigners in the case and each has been allegedly found to have independently committed the offence for which he /she has been charge-sheeted. Further investigations are pending, the IO said. These foreigners had attended the event in March, following which in April Covid-19 cases across the country spiked after hundreds of Tablighi Jamaat members, who had attended the religious congregation at Nizamuddin Markaz, tested positive. According to the chargesheets, all the foreigners have been booked for violation of visa rules, guidelines issued in the wake of Covid-19 pandemic, Epidemic Diseases Act, Disaster Management Act and prohibitory orders under section 144 of Code of Criminal Procedure. They have also been booked for offences under sections 188 (Disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant), 269 (Negligent act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life), 270 (Malignant act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life) and 271 (Disobedience to quarantine rule) of the Indian Penal Code and relevant sections of the Foreigners Act. The punishment for these offences ranges from six months to eight years’ imprisonment. The Centre has cancelled their visas and blacklisted them.  The foreigners have not been arrested yet and are residing at various places approved by the Delhi High Court. At least 9,000 people including the foreign nationals participated in the religious congregation of the Tablighi Jamaat at Nizamuddin Markaz.  Later, many of the attendees travelled to various parts of the country. An FIR was registered against Tablighi Jamaat leader Maulana Saad Kandhalvi and six others on March 31 on a complaint of the Station House Officer of Nizamuddin under sections of the Epidemic Diseases Act, Disaster Management Act (2005), Foreigners Act and other relevant sections of Indian Penal Code. Kandhalvi was later booked for culpable homicide not amounting to murder after some of the attendees of the religious congregation died due to Covid-19, police said.  \",\"document_ocr\":\"AON RON\\n\",\"Category\":\"Insufficient_Text\"},{\"Id\":34913,\"claim_image\":\"http://pbs.twimg.com/media/Ei3yMKSWkAEjshS.jpg?format=jpg&name=large\",\"claim\":\"“Should I be confirmed, I will be mindful of who came before me,” Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett says about Ruth Bader Ginsburg. “…She not only broke glass ceilings, she smashed them.” https://t.co/9iuIR1ng1T https://t.co/9sCacblALG\",\"claim_ocr\":\"White House Rose Garden\\n5:16 PM ET\\nBREAKING NEWS\\nTRUMP NOMINATES AMY CONEY BARRETT AS SUPREME COURT JUSTICE CNN\\nJudge Amy Coney Barrett | Supreme Court Nominee\\n2:16 PM PT\\nSITUATION ROOM\\nPRES\\nく\\n*****\\nLIN\\n\",\"document_image\":\"http://pbs.twimg.com/media/Ei3vYhWWAAAkh4g.jpg?format=jpg&name=large\",\"document\":\"The move sets up what promises to be a bitter confirmation fight. President Trump announces Supreme Court nomineePresident Donald Trump on Saturday announced his nomination of federal Judge Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court to fill the seat of the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. The move to select Barrett sets up what promises to be a bitter confirmation fight less than two months before Election Day -- an unexpected twist in an election season already fraught with the coronavirus pandemic and attempts by the president to undermine confidence in the result. It also promises to upend the relative ideological balance that has marked the court for decades, establishing a clear conservative majority should Trump's nominee be seated. \\\"Judge Barrett was confirmed to the circuit court three years ago by a bipartisan vote.  Her qualifications are unsurpassed.  Unsurpassed and her record is beyond reproach.  This should be a straightforward and prompt confirmation,\\\" Trump said during the Rose Garden announcement. He added, \\\"Rulings that the Supreme Court will issue in the coming years will decide the survival of our Second Amendment, our religious liberty, our public safety and so much more.  To maintain security, liberty and prosperity, we must preserve our priceless heritage of a nation of laws.  And there's no one better to do that than Amy Coney Barrett. \\\"Upon her nomination, Barrett said, \\\"I love the United States, and I love the United States' Constitution.  I'm truly humbled by the prospect of serving on the Supreme Court. \\\"A devout Catholic, mother of seven and the favored choice of conservative groups, Barrett is a relative newcomer to the federal bench, having served just three years on the Chicago-based 7th Circuit Court of Appeals.  Despite her short tenure as a federal judge, the longtime Notre Dame Law professor emerged as the front-runner on Trump's shortlist in the days following Ginsburg's death. At 48, Barrett is the youngest Supreme Court nominee since Clarence Thomas in 1991, and could expect to serve well into the middle of the century – an attractive prospect to Trump and his allies on Capitol Hill. Barrett's appeal within the administration has also been shaped in part by her reputation as a protégé of the late Justice Antonin Scalia, an icon of the religious right for whom she once clerked, sources said. For Democrats, Barrett's conservative tilt and religious affiliation – expressed largely through her prolific catalog of scholarly writings – made her approval to the federal bench in 2017 a bitter affair.  During a combative confirmation hearing for the post, Barrett became a rock star in conservative circles – not for what she told the committee, but what a powerful Senator said to her. \\\"Whatever a religion is, it has its own dogma.  The law is totally different,\\\" said California Sen.  Dianne Feinstein, the committee's ranking Democrat.  \\\"I think in your case, professor … the dogma lives loudly within you, and that is of concern. \\\"Feinstein's comments drew rebukes from religious freedom groups and Republican senators.  Her phrase, \\\"the dogma lives loudly within you,\\\" has since made its way onto tee shirts and mugs for sale on the internet. During the same hearing, Barrett said, \\\"I take my faith seriously and I'm a faithful Catholic,\\\" but assured senators that it is \\\"never appropriate to impose a judge's personal convictions, whether they arise from faith or anywhere else, on the law. \\\"Professor Rick Garnett, a former colleague and Barrett's neighbor, said the \\\"grace\\\" with which Barrett fielded Feinstein's remarks appealed to religious conservatives and improved her standing with those in the administration. \\\"The way she handled that [hearing] elevated her in the public conversation,\\\" Garnett told ABC News.  \\\"It's not just that some of the senators said some strange things about religion, but it was that then-Professor Barrett handled it in a dignified way and I think it made a lot of Americans – religious believers of all stripes – feel inspired and proud. \\\"Eventually, the Senate approved her nomination 55-43, with just three Democrats voting across party lines. A self-described originalist, Barrett's tenure as an appellate judge has affirmed her conservative credentials.  She authored a 2018 dissent arguing that convicted felons should not be barred from having guns.  And while she has not issued a ruling yet on abortion, she has twice staked out positions aligned with the anti-abortion movement. Prior to her judgeship, Barrett made a name for herself at Notre Dame Law School, also her alma mater.  During her 2017 confirmation process, her Notre Dame Law colleagues penned a glowing – and unanimous – endorsement letter.  More than 450 former students also advocated her confirmation. She supplemented her time in the classroom – where she taught courses on federal courts, constitutional law, and statutory interpretation – with several scholarly articles on subjects ranging from Supreme Court precedent to due process. In her scholarly work, Barrett has argued for Catholic judges to recuse themselves from death penalty cases, citing the \\\"the moral impossibility of enforcing capital punishment,\\\" and suggested that legal precedent is susceptible to being overturned, leading critics to question how she would consider the landmark abortion ruling Roe v.  Wade.  In 2013, Barrett was quoted in the Notre Dame student newspaper as saying that \\\"it is very unlikely at this point that the court is going to overturn Roe [v.  Wade]. \\\"During the 2017 confirmation, Barrett walked back her position on the death penalty, telling senators that she would not recuse \\\"as a blanket matter\\\" from capital punishment cases.  On abortion, she stood by past comments that \\\"abortion … is always immoral,\\\" but added that, if confirmed, her \\\"views on this or any other question will have no bearing on the discharge of [her] duties as a judge. \\\"Scrutiny of Barrett's faith has also extended to her personal affiliations, particularly her longtime ties to a Charismatic Christian community called People of Praise. The group encourages its more than 1,700 members to make a covenant to the community, and it also assigns younger members a personal mentor, known as a \\\"head\\\" or \\\"leader. \\\" Until recently, women in those roles were referred to as \\\"handmaids,\\\" which led some news outlets and commentators to speculate that People of Praise may have been the inspiration behind Margaret Atwood's famous novel, \\\"The Handmaid's Tale. \\\" Both Atwood and People of Praise denied those claims. Barrett has not spoken publicly about her involvement in People of Praise, and neither the group nor an aide to Barrett would comment on her current status with the organization.  Critics suggest her ties to the community and a covenant many members make – which the group describes as \\\"a promise of love and service we choose to make to one another\\\" – may conflict with her oath to uphold the constitution.  For its part, People of Praise denies that its practices would have any effect on a member's professional life. Barrett's confirmation process is expected to be strained by the political pressure of a nomination and hearing so close to a presidential election. Democrats have accused Republicans of hypocrisy in moving forward with a replacement for Ginsburg, who died last week with only 45 days before the November vote.  In 2016, Republicans blocked President Barack Obama's Supreme Court nominee, Judge Merrick Garland, after Scalia's death more than 200 days before the election. A native of Louisiana, Barrett attended Rhodes College in Memphis, Tenn. , for undergraduate studies before earning her law degree summa cum laude from the Notre Dame in 1997.  After graduating law school, Barrett clerked for Judge Laurence Silberman of the D. C.  Circuit Court of Appeals and then Scalia before a brief stint in private practice in Washington, D. C. Her husband, Jesse Barrett, served as an Assistant U. S.  Attorney in the Northern District of Indiana. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events\",\"document_ocr\":\"abc NEWSLIVE\\nOF THE\\nRESIDENT\\nUNIT\\n*******\\n\",\"Category\":\"Insufficient_Text\"},{\"Id\":34914,\"claim_image\":\"http://pbs.twimg.com/media/DydbhY9UwAApOV_.jpg?format=jpg&name=large\",\"claim\":\"Amit Shah at launch of #BharatKeMannKiBaat in Delhi:Before 2014,for over 30 yrs,there were coalition govts.

Impeachment hearings become civics lesson for Pennsylvania middle schoolersOn Day 5 of the House impeachment hearings, Fiona Hill, a former Russia expert on the National Security Council, and David Holmes, a political counselor at U. S.  embassy in Ukraine, testifed following a day of explosive testimony on Wednesday.  Hill  has described a July 10 White House meeting with Ukrainian officials in which Gordon Sondland, Trump’s pick for ambassador to the European Union, pressured Ukraine for a political investigation and insisted acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney had agreed to the plan.  Following the meeting, Hill said John Bolton, the president’s national security adviser at the time, told her to tell the president’s legal adviser, “that I am not part of whatever drug deal Sondland and Mulvaney are cooking up. ”Holmes has described a July 26 phone conversation between President Trump  and Sondland where he said he overheard the president asking Sondland about \\\"the investigations. \\\"Here is how the hearing unfolded.  4:19 p. m. ABC's Benjamin Siegel reports from the hearing room: This was Schiff as angry and emotional as I've ever seen him in one of these settings. He denounced Republicans, and attempted to dismantle their defense of the president.  Drawing on his background as a prosecutor, he laid out the case Democrats believe they have assembled against the president. Schiff said Trump's alleged conduct is \\\"far more serious\\\" than Watergate and \\\"beyond anything that Nixon did. \\\"\\\"The difference between then and now is not the difference between Nixon and Trump.  It's the difference between that Congress and this one. \\\" \\\"Where is Howard Baker?  Where are the people that are willing to go beyond their party to look to their duty? \\\"Schiff noted that he was one of the most prominent holdouts against impeachment.  For months, when asked by reporters about his position, he warned that pursuing impeachment along party lines would fail. In his closing remarks, he said that it all came down to \\\"timing,\\\" and the fact that Trump's call with Zelenskiy took place one day after Mueller testified. \\\"I resisted going down this path for a long time, but I will tell you why I could resist no more.  And it came down to this.  It actually came down to timing.  It came down to the fact that the day after Bob Mueller testified, the day after Bob Mueller testified that Donald Trump invited Russian interference, hey, Russia, if you're listening, come get Hillary's emails, and later that day, they tried to hack her server.  The day after he testified that not only did Trump invite that interference, but that he welcomed the help in the campaign, they made full use of it.  They lied about it.  They obstructed the investigation into it,\\\" Schiff said. \\\"The day after that, Donald Trump is back on the phone asking another nation to involve itself in another U. S.  election,\\\" he added. As he closed, he invoked the late Elijah Cummings, his voice breaking with emotion:\\\"That says to me, this president believes that he is above the law, beyond accountability.  And in my view, there is nothing more dangerous than an unethical president who believes they are above the law.  And I would just say to people watching here at home and around the world, in the words of my great colleague, \\\"We are better than that. \\\"4:13 p. m. Nunes wrapped up the scheduled public hearings by again calling the process a \\\"show trial\\\" and accusing the Democrats of pursuing a predetermined outcome to hurt President Trump. \\\"What you see in this room over the past two weeks is a show trial.  The plane a result of three years of political operations and dirty tricks.  Campaigns waged against this president.  And like any good show trial, the verdict was decided before the trials ever began.  After all, after denouncing the president for years as a Russian agent and a threat to democracy, how could the Democrats not impeach him? \\\" he said. Nunes said Republicans don't know if there will be more public hearings or the exact next steps for the process but said \\\"this farce will soon move to the judiciary committee where impeachment rightfully belongs. \\\"Schiff then countered some of the minority's complaints about how the impeachment inquiry has been conducted, quipping \\\"only over 100 members of congress are able to participate in those secret depositions. \\\"3:41 p. m. Hill testified that she did not think Ambassador Sondland's claim that he didn't realize the connection between the energy company Burisma and Hunter Biden was credible, saying that combined with references to 2016 she thought the implication was clear. \\\"It is not credible to me that he was oblivious.  He did not say Bidens, however, he said Burisma, he said 2016.  I took it to mean the elections as well as Burisma,\\\" she said. 3:39 p. m. Democratic Rep.  Sean Maloney referenced an ABC News/Ipsos poll that found 70% of Americans think President Donald Trump’s request to a foreign leader to investigate his political rival was wrong as the hearing with Hill and Holmes wraps up. That poll found that a slim majority of Americans, 51%, believe Trump’s actions were both wrong and he should be impeached and removed from office.  But only 21% of Americans say they are following the hearings very closely. 3:22 p. m. ABC's Benjamin Siegel in the hearing room reports on two notable moments from moderate Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee -- the latest indication Republicans remain united in their opposition to impeachment after nearly 30 hours of public witness testimony. Rep.  Mike Turner, R-Ohio, who has criticized Trump's comments on the phone call with Zelenskiy as being \\\"not OK,\\\" appeared to mock Democrats impeachment efforts. \\\"Do you guys want to be the laughingstock of history to impeach a president for not taking a meeting?  Oh God, please undertake that,\\\" he asked rhetorically. Republican Rep.  Will Hurd said he found President Trump's July 25 call with Ukrainian President Zelenskiy \\\"inappropriate\\\" and \\\"misguided,\\\" but said he hasn't seen any blatant evidence he engaged in an impeachable act. \\\"We have heard of U. S.  officials carrying uncoordinated confusing an conflicting messages that created doubt and uncertainty in Kiev at a time when they knew [a] reformist administration has just taken office and was ready to fight corruption and work with us to advance other U. S.  objectives,\\\" he said.   \\\"I disagree with this sort of bungling foreign policy. \\\"\\\"An impeachable offense should be compelling, overwhelmingly clear and unambiguous.  And it's not something to be rushed or taken lightly.  I have not heard evidence proving the president committed bribery or extortion,\\\" Hurd said. 2:52  p. m. Democratic Rep.  Jackie Speier asked Hill about an anecdote where one of Hill's pigtails were set on fire by a boy while she was taking a test when she was 11 years old. \\\"You turned around with your hands snuffed out the fire and proceeded to finish your test.  Is that a true story? \\\" Speier asked. Hill said it was true and she was surprised to see it surface.  The anecdote was included in a New York Times profile of Hill. \\\"It is a true story.  Unfortunate consequences afterwards.  My mom gave me a bowl haircut.  So, for the photograph later in that week I looked like Richard III,\\\" Hill said. 2:30 p. m. ABC's Katherine Faulders reports from inside the hearing room that GOP Rep.  Mike Turner just spent five minutes attacking Hill's credibility, saying \\\"you have provided me probably the greatest piece of evidence that's before us to illustrate the problem with hearsay. \\\"\\\"Do you guys want to be the laughingstock of history to impeach a president for not taking a meeting?  Oh God, please undertake that. \\\"\\\"Is there a question for Dr.  Hill? \\\" her lawyer replied.  There wasn't. Later, after GOP Rep.  Brad Wenstrup made remarks about his military service and shared concerns about partisanship and hatred, Hill commented it was a shame Turner and another Republican Rep.  John Ratcliffe, had left the room and thanked Wenstrup for his comments, calling them eloquent and moving. \\\"\\\"I think all of us who came here under legal obligation also felt we had a moral obligation to do so.  We came as fact witnesses,\\\" Hill said. \\\"I think it was unfair for people to already call the election and to make attacks also on candidate Trump and on President Trump,\\\" she added. \\\"And I know that this has put a huge cloud over this presidency and also over our whole democratic system.  That's actually why as a non-partisan person and as an expert on Russia and an expert on Vladimir Putin and on the Russian security services I wanted to come in to serve the country to try to see if I could help. \\\"2:20 p. m. GOP Rep.  Jim Jordan, using Rep.  Nunes' time, asks Holmes why Ambassador William Taylor, the top U. S.  diplomat in Ukraine, who testified last week, did not initially tell House impeachment investigators about the July 26 phone call between Trump and Sondland. \\\"Maybe Mr.  Holmes, the takeaway was he thought it was no big deal because he already knew! \\\" Jordan said, appearing to downplay the overheard conversation. \\\"The [Trump-Zelenskiy] transcript had been out for two months.  Maybe the ambassador thought there is nothing new here.  But, shazam, last week you come forward with supposed this new information, and nothing different in there than what we had on the transcript.  Maybe that's the reason their star witness, first witness didn't bring it up.  You're their closing witness. \\\"Holmes, after a testy back-and-forth between Jordan and Schiff, responded. \\\"It was not news for him that the president was pressing for a Biden investigation,\\\" he said.  \\\"It's exactly my point.  I briefed the call and when we come back and I referred to the call and everyone is nodding.  Of course, that's what's going on.  Of course the president is pressing for a Biden investigation before he'll do these things the Ukrainians want.  There is nodding agreement.  Did I go through every single word in the call?  No, because everyone by that point agreed. \\\"\\\"He was involved in a number of other interactions you've outlined that brought him to the same conclusion. \\\"Rep.  John Ratcliffe, R-Texas, then pushed Holmes on his recollection of the phone call, appearing skeptical that Holmes happened to overhear only the part related to Trump and Ukraine. 1:58 p. m. Schiff just asked Hill, who was born and raised in northern England, if she wanted to respond to some of the dual-loyalty attacks her former colleague Lt.  Col.  Alexander Vindman, a Ukraine expert on the National Security Council, has faced over the last few weeks. \\\"Everyone immigrated here at some point in their family history.  Some people perhaps came reluctantly.  Others game by choice as I did, but this is for me the essence of America,\\\" she said. \\\"I'm Anglo-American, I'm British American.  I'm a naturalized citizen.  My loyalty is not to the United Kingdom, it is to my country and the country I serve.  I know there are many natural-raised citizens in my office and across the National Security Council who felt the same way.  I think it is deeply unfair,\\\" Hill said. 1:50 p. m. Hill responded to a question by Schiff about the exchange during which Bolton, according to Hill, called what was happening a \\\"drug deal,” describing the instance in full:Hill said Bolton “was escorting out the Ukrainian visitors along with Secretary Perry and Ambassadors Volker and Sondland,” after the meeting and told Hill to wait in the room. “And I guess they wanted to take a quick photograph outside of his office and I know that Secretary Perry and others tweeted out that photograph -- beautiful, sunny day and a picture of them standing outside ambassador Bolton's office,” Hill said. She went on to say: “This was very quick he came back in at that point they were already moving down to the boardroom because on the way out of Bolton's office, Ambassador Sondland said let's regroup in the boardroom for quick huddle on next steps. ”Hill called this move “quite unusual. ”“When Ambassador Bolton came back into the office, that’s when he gave me the very strong instruction to go downstairs, find out what was being discussed and come right back up and report it to him,” she said. When she arrived at the boardroom, Hill describes seeing Colonel Vindman looking “quite alarmed. ”“When I came in, Ambassador Sondland was in an exchange with Colonel Vindman along the lines of, well, we have an agreement to have this meeting,” she said. Hill said Energy Secretary Rick Perry had left, so he “has no recollection of this meeting because he was not in it. ”“So, when I came in, Gordon Sondland was supposedly saying, look, we have a deal that there will be a meeting.  I have a deal with chief of staff Mulvaney, there will be a meeting if the Ukrainians open up or announce these investigations into 2016 and Burisma and I cut it off immediately there,” Hill recounted. “Because by this point after having heard Giuliani over and over again on the television and all the issues that he was asserting, by this point, it was clear that Burisma was code for the Bidens because Giuliani was laying it out there.  I could see why colonel was alarmed and he [Bolton] said, ‘This is inappropriate, we're the national security council and we can't be involved in this. ’”1:41 p. m. Hill, who said she watched Sondland's testimony carefully on Wednesday, pushed back on his statements that \\\"everyone was in the loop\\\" when it came to Ukraine. Sondland said he was surprised concerns were being raised because so many high-level officials were informed on their efforts.  But Hill said she now understands why they weren't able to work together. \\\"He was absolutely right because he was being involved in a domestic political errand, and we were being involved in national security foreign policy, and those two things had just diverged.  I was irritated with him and angry with him that he wasn't fully coordinating and I did say to him, Ambassador Sondland, I think this is all going to blow up, and here we are,\\\" Hill said. She went on to say that there were discussions about ways to coordinate better, however, Hill said, \\\"His feeling was that the national security council was always trying to block him. \\\"Hill attempted to clarify: \\\"What we were trying to do is block us from straying into domestic or personal politics, and that was precisely what I was trying to do. \\\"1:28 p. m. ABC'S Benjamin Siegel reports from the hearing room: Hill, under questioning from Republicans, said there were \\\"differences\\\" in \\\"understanding\\\" about the Trump-Zelenskiy July 25 call, repeating that she was opposed to a call, and that then-National Security Adviser John Bolton was as well. \\\"I know that Ambassador Sondland said in that email that Bolton was in agreement.  To my knowledge, Bolton was not in agreement at that particular juncture,\\\" she said, referencing an email Sondland cited in his prepared opening statement on Wednesday. \\\"It was based on the fact that he didn't feel the call was properly prepared, and as I said earlier, we wanted to make sure that there was going to be a fulsome, bilateral U. S. -Ukraine agenda that was discussed, which is usual with these calls,\\\" she said. 1:05 p. m. As Fiona Hill answers questions from the Republican side, White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham has put out statement that the witnesses testifying at the impeachment hearing as part of the impeachment inquiry “rely heavily on their own presumptions, assumptions and opinions” and “have no personal or direct knowledge regarding why U. S.  aid was temporarily withheld. ”“The Democrats' are clearly being motivated by a sick hatred for President Trump and their rabid desire to overturn the 2016 election,” Grisham said. 1:01 p. m. Schiff gavels the hearing back into session. The top Republican, Rep.  Devin Nunes, has begun the minority questioning. 11:58 a. m. If you missed testimony from the previous hearings, you can catch up on the key takeaways during the break before testimony resumes. 11:04 a. m. After the Democratic counsel finishes his line of questioning, Schiff calls a break to allow members to vote on measure on the House floor.  That's expected to last at least an hour. Just before, Hill also detailed how she saw Bolton respond when Sondland said in a meeting with Ukrainian officials that \\\"we have an agreement that there will be a meeting if specific investigations are put under way. \\\"She clarified that Sondland later said he had an agreement with acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and that she understood \\\"investigations\\\" to be a reference to investigating Burisma and the Bidens. She said she was Bolton \\\"stiffen\\\" after this comment and end the meeting. She testified that Bolton told her after the meeting to report what happened to the National Security Counsel's top lawyer, John Eisenberg, and tell him that Bolton said, \\\"I am not part of this drug deal that Sondland and Mulvaney are cooking up. \\\"Bolton has thus far declined to testify as part of the impeachment inquiry. ABC's John Santucci reports that a Bolton spokesperson declines to comment on Hill's testimony. 10:55 a. m. When asked about then-National security Adviser John Bolton's comment that Rudy Giuliani, the president's personal lawyer, was a \\\"hand grenade,\\\" Hill responded that she knew what he meant when referencing his concerns about Giuliani's public statements about Ukraine. \\\"I think he meant that, obviously, what Mr.  Giuliani was saying was pretty explosive in any case.  He was frequently on television, making quite incendiary remarks about everyone and that he was clearly  pushing forward issues and ideas that would, you know, probably come back to haunt us,\\\" Hill said. \\\"And, in fact, I think that that's where we are today. \\\"10:50 a. m. ABC's Benjamin Siegel in the hearing room reports that when Holmes was asked to explain his \\\"specific and clear\\\" recollection of part of the Trump-Sondland call, Holmes told the committee it was a \\\"very distinctive experience. \\\"\\\"I've never seen anything like this in my foreign service career, someone at a lunch in a restaurant making a call on a cell phone to the president of the United States, being able to hear his voice, very distinctive personality,\\\" Holmes said. \\\"We've all seen him on television.  Very colorful language was used.  They were directly addressing something that I had been wondering working on for weeks and even months a topic that had led to the recall of my former boss, the former ambassador. \\\"And so here was a person who said he had direct contact with the president, and said that over the course of time.  Here he is, actually having that contact with the president.  Hearing the president's voice and then talking about this issue of the Biden investigation that I had been hearing about,\\\" Holmes said. 10:40 a. m. ABC's Jordyn Phelps at the White House notes that President Trump has taken to Twitter to take issue with Holmes' testimony that a call not on speakerphone could possibly be overheard by another person not on the phone. Holmes had testified a few minutes earlier that Trump was speaking so loudly that Gordon Sondland had held his phone away from his ear and that Holmes, sitting at the table with Sondland, could clearly hear Trump's voice asking about \\\"investigations. \\\"The president notes that he has “been watching people making phone calls my entire life” and that his hearing is “great. ”\\\"@realDonaldTrump: I have been watching people making phone calls my entire life.  My hearing is, and has been, great.  Never have I been watching a person making a call, which was not on speakerphone, and been able to hear or understand a conversation.  I’ve even tried, but to no avail.  Try it live! \\\"10:24 a. m. Schiff thanked Hill for testifying, saying, \\\"Your story reminds me a great deal of what we heard from Alexander Vindman,\\\" recalling Thursday's testimony.  \\\"The few immigrant stories we've heard in the course of these hearings are among the most powerful, I think, I've ever heard.  You and Colonel Vindman and others are the best of this country and you came here by choice.  And we are so blessed that you did, so welcome,\\\" Schiff said. Hill followed up to emphasize that Russia would have tried to delegitimize any American president after 2016, saying the country has a vested interest in damaging relationships between the U. S.  and its allies. Hill said she wanted to make a strong point when she called for Republicans on the committee to stop perpetuating the narrative that Ukraine interfered in the 2016 election, saying that there was a lot of criticism of presidential candidates from all over the world during that election but that Russia especially uses those comments to create chaos in the U. S. \\\"What we're seeing here as a result of all of these narratives, this is exactly what the Russian government was hoping for.  If they seed misinformation, they seed doubt, they have everybody questioning the legitimacy of a presidential candidate, be it president Trump or potentially a president Clinton, that they would pit one side of our electorate against the other, that they would pit one party against the other,\\\" Hill said. 10:12 a. m. As noted earlier, in her opening statement, Hill warns the \\\"fictional narrative\\\" that Ukraine interfered in American elections and not Russia.  The consensus among intelligence agencies and congressional investigators is that Russia has sought to interfere in American elections for decades and actively did so in 2016. She blasted Republicans and other partisan figures who have perpetuated misinformation about Ukraine, saying political divisions make it harder to combat the problem. \\\"Some of you on this committee appear to believe that Russia and its security services did not conduct a campaign against our country and that perhaps, somehow, for some reason, Ukraine did,\\\" she says. \\\"This is a fictional narrative,\\\" Hill says emphatically. “The unfortunate truth is that Russia was the foreign power that systematically attacked our democratic institutions in 2016.  This is the public conclusion of our intelligence agencies, confirmed in bipartisan congressional reports.  It is beyond dispute, even if some of the underlying details must remain classified,\\\" Hill says. \\\"I refuse to be part of an effort to legitimize an alternate narrative that the Ukrainian government is a U. S.  adversary, and that Ukraine—not Russia—attacked us in 2016,\\\" Hill  says. \\\"When we are consumed by partisan rancor, we cannot combat these external forces as they seek to divide us against each another, degrade our institutions, and destroy the faith of the American people in our democracy,\\\" Hill says. 9:57 a. m. Holmes described his recollection of a phone call between Sondland and Trump on July 26, the day after the controversial call between Trump and Zelenskiy. Holmes said he could hear Trump's voice on the other end of the line during the call, saying he asked \\\"So, he's gonna do the investigation? \\\" in reference to Zelenskiy.  He said Sondland responded that Zelenskiy will \\\"do anything you ask him to. \\\"After Sondland hung up with the president Holmes said he described Trump as being \\\"in a bad mood. \\\"\\\"I then took the opportunity to ask Ambassador Sondland for his candid impression of the President’s views on Ukraine.  In particular, I asked Ambassador Sondland if it was true that the President did not “give a s--t about Ukraine. ” Ambassador Sondland agreed that the President did not “give a s--t about Ukraine,” Holmes said. \\\"I asked why not, and Ambassador Sondland stated that the President only cares about “big stuff. ” I noted that there was “big stuff” going on in Ukraine, like a war with Russia, and Ambassador Sondland replied that he meant “big stuff” that benefits the President, like the “Biden investigation” that Mr.  Giuliani was pushing. \\\"Sondland testified Wednesday that he does not recall specific details of his call with the president but has no reason to doubt Holmes testimony. ABC's Benjamin Siegel reports from the hearing room that Holmes' testimony, like Sondland's, again underscores how limited Democrats' investigation has been by the Trump administration's refusal to cooperate with subpoenas and the impeachment inquiry. Recalling the U. S.  delegation's visit to Ukraine for Zelenskiy's inauguration in May, Holmes recalled a conversation between Energy Secretary Perry and Zelenskiy about energy sector reform, where Perry passed Holmes a list of \\\"people he trusts\\\" on the subject, which was a topic of \\\"subsequent meetings\\\" between Perry and Ukrainian energy officials. \\\"Embassy personnel were excluded from these later meetings by Secretary Perry's staff,\\\" Holmes said. Perry and the Energy Department have refused to cooperate with Democrats, making it difficult for the committee to follow up with any questions about these meetings that took place without embassy staff. Leadership hasn't stated it publicly, but Democrats and aides tell ABC News the Intelligence Committee is likely to transmit its work to the Judiciary Committee around the beginning of December, and that the House remains on track to vote on articles of impeachment  by the end of the year. 9:50 a. m. Holmes says Sondland told him the Ukrainian president needed to make clear he would not stand in the way of \\\"investigations,\\\" which Holmes said he understood to mean investigations into the Burisma energy company and the Bidens. \\\"While Ambassador Taylor did not brief me on every detail of his communications with 'The Three Amigos,' he did tell me that on a June 28 call with President Zelenskiy, Ambassador Taylor, and the Three Amigos, it was made clear that some action on a Burisma/Biden investigation was a precondition for an Oval Office meeting,\\\" he says. Holmes says he became concerned that even if the two presidents met Trump may not show sufficient support for Ukraine, which he said could have been more damaging to the relationship between the two countries. 9:45 a. m. In his opening statement, Holmes details his knowledge of the allegations against former Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch, who was removed from her role, and the impact of her removal on the relationship between the U. S.  and incoming Ukrainian administration. \\\"The barrage of allegations directed at Ambassador Yovanovitch, a career ambassador, is unlike anything I have seen in my professional career,\\\" he said. 9:26 a. m.  In his opening statement Ranking Member Devin Nunes continued to attack Democrats over the impeachment inquiry, calling the proceedings a \\\"kangaroo court\\\" and a \\\"spectacle\\\" intended to undermine the president. \\\"Whether the Democrats reap the political benefit they want from this impeachment remains to be seen.  But the damage they have done to this country will be long-lasting,\\\" he said. Nunes also filed another request to bring Republican witnesses for a day of hearings, repeating calls from the minority that they be able to question Hunter Biden and the whistleblower, among others.  Schiff his indicated he will not call those witnesses to testify. Nunes also pushed back on part of Hill's prepared opening statement, where she accused some committee members of denying Russia's efforts to interfere in American elections. Nunes held up the Intelligence Committee report on Russian election interference from Republicans on the committee and staff handed copies to Hill and Holmes.  The report authored by Republicans cleared President Trump of any collusion between his campaign and Russian actors. More background from ABC News' Ben Siegel: House Republicans also raised questions in the report about the intelligence community's findings that Russia sought to boost Trump and hurt Hillary Clinton in 2016.  Special counsel Bob Mueller would later testify to the House Judiciary Committee that Russia wanted Trump to win, and the leaders of the Senate Intelligence Committee have affirmed the same conclusion. Democrats said they refused to sign on to the report because they didn't find the GOP findings credible, and because Republicans failed to interview a number of witnesses. Holmes also said that while officials were making progress on anti-corruption efforts, commercial deals, and energy sector reforms with the Zelenskiy administration he did not see any improvements in Trump's view of Ukraine, seeming to undermine the Republican argument that the administration was focused on dealing with corruption. 9:13 a. m. Schiff continues by revisiting some of the details of Hill and Holmes' closed-door testimony. Hill testified she became concerned about the role of Rudy Giuliani, the president's personal lawyer, took in Ukraine policy, saying then-National Security Adviser John Bolton described Giuliani as “a hand grenade that is going to blow everybody up\\\" and said she clashed with EU Ambassador Gordon Sondland who she said told her the president put him in charge of Ukraine. \\\"In the coming days, Congress will determine what response is appropriate,\\\" Schiff said in his opening statement.   \\\"If the President abused his power and invited foreign interference in our elections, if he sought to condition, coerce, extort, or bribe a vulnerable ally into conducting investigations to aid his reelection campaign and did so by withholding official acts — a White House meeting or hundreds of millions of dollars of needed military aid — it will be up to us to decide, whether those acts are compatible with the office of the Presidency,\\\" Schiff said. 9:06 a. m.  House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff gavels the hearing into session. He begins his opening statement by reviewing what he said were the investigation President Donald Trump wanted. \\\"The first investigation was of a discredited conspiracy theory that Ukraine and not Russia was responsible for interfering in our 2016 election.   The second investigation was into the political rival Trump apparently feared most, Joe Biden,\\\" Schiff said. \\\"Trump sought to weaken Biden, and to refute the fact that his own election had been helped by a Russian hacking and dumping operation and Russian social media campaign directed by Vladimir Putin,\\\" he said. Hill will deliver her opening statement first, after Schiff and the top Republican on the committee, Rep.  Devin Nunes. Hill shared some of her personal backstory in her opening statement.  She became a U. S.  citizen in 2002 after emigrating from England.  Her ancestors fought in both World Wars and she said many of the men in her father's family were coal miners.  Her father wanted to move to the United States in the 1960s after coal mines closed in England but stayed to care for her grandmother until 2012.  Her mother still lives in England. \\\"While his dream of emigrating to America was thwarted, my father loved America, its culture, its history and its role as a beacon of hope in the world.  He always wanted someone in the family to make it to the United States,\\\" she said. In her career, Hill says, became a \\\"nonpartisan, nonpolitical national security professional\\\" focused on Europe and the former Soviet Union.  She says the turning point was when she attended the signing of a nuclear treaty between President Ronald Reagan met Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev in Moscow in 1987. 8:35 a. m. ABC News White House reporter Jordyn Phelps highlights that President Trump is very active on Twitter this morning in blasting the impeachment probe and expressing disbelief that his name has been associated with the “the ugly word, Impeachment. ”@realDonaldTrump: \\\"I never in my wildest dreams thought my name would in any way be associated with the ugly word, Impeachment!  The calls (Transcripts) were PERFECT, there was NOTHING said that was wrong.  No pressure on Ukraine.  Great corruption & dishonesty by Schiff on the other side! \\\"This isn’t the first time the president has let on just how much he’s bothered on a personal level by the impeachment inquiry, even as he also simultaneously strikes a defiant tone of confidence that the inquiry is actually helping him politically. Back on Oct.  12, the president said: “I never thought I’d see or hear that word with respect to me -- an ugly word, it means so much, it means horrible, horrible crimes and things, I can’t even believe it, it’s a witch hunt. ”8:30 a. m. Both Hill and Holmes have arrived on Capitol Hill. Hill's opening statement, obtained by ABC News ahead of the hearing, warns of the \\\"fictional narrative\\\" that Ukraine interfered in American elections and not Russia. The consensus among intelligence agencies and congressional investigators is that Russia has sought to interfere in American elections for decades and actively did so in 2016. “The unfortunate truth is that Russia was the foreign power that systematically attacked our democratic institutions in 2016.  This is the public conclusion of our intelligence agencies, confirmed in bipartisan Congressional reports.  It is beyond dispute, even if some of the underlying details must remain classified,\\\" Hill is expected to say in her opening statement. She's also expected to blast Republicans and other partisan figures who perpetuate misinformation about Ukraine, saying political divisions make it harder to combat the problem. \\\"I refuse to be part of an effort to legitimize an alternate narrative that the Ukrainian government is a U. S.  adversary, and that Ukraine—not Russia—attacked us in 2016,\\\" Hill will say. Russian President Vladimir Putin expressed relief at an event in Moscow Wednesday, saying \\\"thank God\\\" no one is accusing us of interfering in American elections anymore. \\\"Thank God, no one is accusing us of interfering in U. S.  elections anymore; now they're accusing Ukraine - well, let them sort it out among themselves.  But this factor of the domestic political struggle affects— still negatively affects-- Russian-American relations, I hope that this will someday end.  We are ready for this,\\\" he said, according to ABC News' Patrick Reevell in Moscow. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events\",\"document_ocr\":\"abc\\nNEWS\\nDR.

Trump hails Kim Jong Un as 'great leader' at summitWith President Donald Trump in Vietnam this week, advocates are continuing calls for his administration to fully reverse moves to deport refugees who came to the U. S.  in the wake of the Vietnam War. The issue has left many in a state of uncertainty over the possibility of deportation and lawmakers joined activists on Capitol Hill Wednesday calling on the administration to stop what they call a targeting of Asian American immigrants. “The administration is clearly trying to deport as many immigrants as possible,” Democratic Rep.  Judy Chu of California told ABC News. The issue centers on the Trump administration’s reconsideration of a 2008 bilateral agreement between the U. S.  and Vietnam that effectively stopped deportation orders for Vietnamese nationals who arrived in America prior to 1995. Immigration court removal orders for Vietnamese nationals steadily declined throughout most of the Obama administration and have leveled off in recent years. A lawsuit from the nonprofit advocacy group Asian Americans Advancing Justice revealed the administration's wavering posture last year. The court challenge, brought against the Department of Homeland Security, relies in part on a 2001 Supreme Court ruling that prevents extended detention for immigrants whose country of origin will not accept their return. “It’s part of a larger practice and pattern that we have seen with this administration,\\\" said Phi Nguyen, one of the lawyers who brought the class action lawsuit.  \\\"There’s a lot of, I think, abuse of power. ”In court documents from April of last year, an Immigration and Customs Enforcement official acknowledged the agency’s efforts to remove Vietnamese nationals who had previous orders of removal. But in September, the same official said senior ICE officials had met with the Vietnamese government and determined they could not carry out the removals. “ICE has no arrests policy specific to particular nationalities,” ICE spokesperson Brendan Raedy said in response to questions from ABC News.  “ICE remains committed to directing its enforcement resources to those aliens posing the greatest risk to the safety and security of the United States. ”Concern over deportation orders has prompted action from within Vietnamese communities across the country.  In recent months, Vietnamese Americans rallied in Seattle, New Orleans and Orange County, California. “Our families came to America as war-torn refugees, after narrowly escaping the horrors of the Vietnam War,” said Matt Nguyen, a local community activist who participated in the Orange County rally and formerly worked on refugee rights for the U. S.  State Department.  “Trump’s new policy reopens old wounds and inflicts incredible pain on our community,” he said. The Vietnam embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The continuing battles pose additional strain for Trump's Republican Party after the traditionally conservative voting patterns of the Vietnamese American community were disrupted in the 2018 midterm elections. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events\",\"document_ocr\":\"No More\\nDeportation\\nNo More\\nFamily Seperato\\nGerald Herbert/AP, FILE\\n\",\"Category\":\"Insufficient_Text\"},{\"Id\":34922,\"claim_image\":\"http://pbs.twimg.com/media/D0bepkYWkAA1gTp.jpg?format=jpg&name=large\",\"claim\":\"The President's former lawyer Michael Cohen testified that Donald Trump directed him to \\\"threaten\\\" Trump's high school, colleges and the College Board to not release his educational records https://t.co/dZvN91dBOW https://t.co/4gRZUOKoWA\",\"claim_ocr\":\"OHIP SOMODEVILLAXEDUARDO MUNOZ ALVAREZ?GETTY IMAGES\\n\",\"document_image\":\"http://pbs.twimg.com/media/D0bMOS8VYAElrGW.jpg?format=jpg&name=large\",\"document\":\"Notable moments included a fight over claims of racism and partisan bickering.  Moments that mattered from Cohen's hearingMichael Cohen, a longtime confidante of the president, his former personal attorney and fixer, arrived on Capitol Hill on Wednesday to share publicly, for the first time, his side of the story. Cohen's fiery testimony, a written version of which was released to ABC News and other news outlets earlier, alleged that President Donald Trump is a \\\"racist,\\\" a \\\"conman\\\" and a \\\"cheat\\\" – and promised documents to back up Cohen's claims. Here are some of the notable moments from the hearing. In his closing remarks, Cohen said his loyalty to Trump \\\"cost him everything. \\\"\\\"I will not sit back, say nothing and allow him to do the same for the country,\\\" he said. He then ran down a list of policy decisions he's seen over the past two years and denounced them all, ticking through criticisms Trump often receives from the other side of the aisle.  Don't \\\"demonize those looking to America for a better life,\\\" Cohen said, and \\\"don't shut down the government before Christmas and New Years just to please your base. \\\"He maintained that he hoped the country would be better off with more of the truth, but warned that there were challenging times to come. \\\"I fear that if [Trump] loses the election in 2020, there will never be a peaceful transition of power,\\\" he said. Ranking member Rep.  Jim Jordan, the Republican from Ohio and a Trump ally who was sharply critical of Cohen throughout the testimony, closed with a warning that Cohen, who is going to prison in two months for charges that include lying to Congress, was not a credible witness. Democratic Rep.  Elijah Cummings, the chair of the committee, spoke last. \\\"I've sat here and I listened to all of this and it's very painful,\\\" he said.  \\\"One of the saddest parts of this whole thing is that some very innocent people are hurting too. \\\" Cohen grew emotional at the mention of his family. Cummings ended on a note of hope. \\\"Hopefully this portion of your destiny will lead to a better . . .  Michael Cohen, a better Donald Trump, a better United States of America, and a better world. \\\"In a moment that required no response from the witness, two members of Congress waded into contentious waters over allegations of racism. Tlaib, one of the last members of Congress to speak, began her time by making the point that Trump is not clear of allegations of being a racist because he had a black woman – Lynne Patton, an official at the Department of Housing and Urban Development who supports Trump and attended as Meadow's guest – as an employee. Tlaib continued: \\\"The fact that someone would even use a prop, a black woman, in this chamber, in this committee, is alone racist in itself. \\\"Meadows immediately objected, calling for her comments to be struck from the record and defending his record of civil rights advocacy.  \\\"My nieces and nephews are people of color.  Not many people know that.  You know that Mr.  Chairman,\\\" Meadows added. Tlaib reread her statement and clarified that she did not intend to call Meadows a racist.  \\\"As a person of color, that's how I felt at that moment and I wanted to express that.  I'm saying it is a racist act,\\\" she said. Cummings jumped in to mitigate the conflict between the freshman Democrat and the senior Republican, speaking as the chair of the committee, the son of sharecroppers, and -- a fact that he said surprises people -- as a very close friend of Meadows. \\\"I can see and feel your pain.  I feel it.  And I don't think Ms.  Tlaib intended to cause you that -- that kind of pain and that kind of frustration. \\\"Questions about his family, who Cohen said he caused \\\"tremendous, tremendous pain,\\\" have led to some of the more emotional moments of his testimony. But there has also been combative frustration – when Republican Rep.  Jim Jordan accused him of not owning up to his crimes, Cohen adamantly pushed back. \\\"Shame on you, Mr.  Jordan.  That's not what I said.  Shame on you,\\\" he said. Here's a look at the wave of emotions during hours of testimony before members of Congress. Democratic Rep.  Brenda Lawrence told Cohen Wednesday that she didn't doubt his stories about racist comments made privately by Trump. \\\"I just want to put on the record as being a black American and having endured the public comments of racism from the sitting president, as being a black person, I can only imagine what's being said in private,\\\" Lawrence said.  The Michigan congresswoman made history in 2001 when she became the first African American and the first woman to be elected the mayor of Southfield, Michigan. Lawrence also called out Republicans for bringing Lynne Patton, an official at the Department of Housing and Urban Affairs, as an apparent attempt at rebutting Cohen's claim that Trump is \\\"racist. \\\" Patton has defended Trump in the past. \\\"To prop up one member of our entire race of black people and say that that nullifies that is totally insulting,\\\" Lawrence said.  \\\"And in this environment of expecting a president to be inclusive, and to look at his administration, speaks volume,\\\" she added, pointing to the lack of diversity in Trump's Cabinet, compared to past presidents. Stormy Daniels, the adult film star who alleged she had an affair with Trump and was kept quiet about it through a $130,000 payment, once detailed the threats of bankruptcy – and worse, she said – she was facing from Cohen. But on Wednesday, Daniels said she was \\\"proud\\\" of the man who once paid her for her silence.  In a statement to ABC News and others, she spoke directly to Cohen. \\\"Michael, I’m proud of you for finally beginning to tell the truth about what you did, and trying to repair some of the harm you have caused.  I can hear the pain and regret you feel for betraying your family and your country.  My heart goes out to you and your family,\\\" said Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford. Daniels went on to say she empathized with him but made it clear that he contributed to the fear she felt then – and he feels now. \\\"You spoke about how the president and his attorney put you and your family in danger by calling you a liar and a rat and disparaging you in public.  I understand your fear, Michael.  I have a family too.  Do you believe now that when you and the president called me a liar when you were his attorney and you insulted me, threatened to bankrupt me and worse, that you put me and my family in danger? \\\" Daniels said in a statement.  \\\"I remember the fear you feel.  I still feel it.  Thank you for having the courage, at long last, to begin to tell the truth.  I hope that someday soon your family and mine can both leave this nightmare behind. \\\"Earlier in his testimony, Cohen described a conversation that seemingly revealed new details about the way Daniels' claims were handled.  (Daniels called Cohen's testimony important and said she didn't want to take the focus away from it, but to briefly address him). Cohen said Trump called him in February of last year to coordinate public messaging about hush money payments, instructing Cohen to say “he was not knowledgeable of the reimbursements and he wasn't knowledgeable of my actions,” Cohen said. While many congressional hearings and confirmations in the past few months have doubled as 2020 campaign platforms, the House Oversight and Reform Committee is relatively devoid of presidential candidates. But in today's politics, the next election is never far. As Cohen testified, Democratic Sen.  Elizabeth Warren – one of the first 2020 candidates to declare a bid – sent out a promise to supporters: If she's elected, \\\"there will be no pardons for anyone implicated in these investigations. \\\"Warren promised no pardons or commutations for anyone charged in the Mueller investigation, anyone implicated in a federal criminal investigation related to Trump, and \\\"no pardon or commutation for Donald Trump himself. \\\"About two hours into a hearing filled with blatant partisan divide, quips from all sides and testy one-liners – \\\"The record reflects that you're not a nice guy,\\\" Republican Rep.  Mark Meadows of North Carolina told Cohen – the president's former fixer called members of Congress out for the combative behavior in an unusual way: by taking responsibility for it. \\\"It's that sort of behavior that I'm responsible for.  I'm responsible for your silliness because I did the same thing that you're doing now for ten years,\\\" Cohen said. \\\"I protected Mr.  Trump for ten years,\\\" Cohen said. Cohen warned Republicans, who he saw as defending the president, to take note of his current position: \\\"The more people that follow Mr.  Trump as I did, blindly, are going to suffer the same consequences that I'm suffering. \\\"Just as Cohen stepped away from the cameras for his first break, the one-and-only Anthony Scaramucci piped up with his reaction to the beginning of the testimony. Scaramucci, who spent 11 days as Trump's communication chief before a sharp exit, had a message for D. C. : it \\\"sucks,\\\" he said. It wasn't clear who, exactly, Scaramucci was referring to. The president, who has a 12-hour time difference while in Vietnam, has yet to chime in on the hearing – but did retweet himself at the beginning of the testimony. \\\"He is lying in order to reduce his prison time,\\\" Trump tweeted. Cohen’s 30-minute opening statement was rife with emotion — a detailed thread of the lies and offensive rhetoric then-candidate and now-President Trump allegedly used, interlaced with Cohen’s own admission that he continued, again and again, to participate in acts he knew were wrong, and at times, unlawful. One of those moments, Cohen said, now holds great irony. \\\"Mr.  Trump tasked me to handle the negative press surrounding his medical deferment from the Vietnam draft,\\\" Cohen said.  \\\"Mr.  Trump claimed it was because of a bone spur.  But when I asked for medical records, he gave me none and said that there was no surgery.  He told me not to answer the specific questions by reporters, but rather offer simply the fact that he received a medical deferment.  He finished the conversation with the following comment, 'you think I'm stupid, I'm not going to Vietnam. '\\\"\\\"And I find it ironic, Mr.  President, that you are in Vietnam right now,\\\" Cohen said. Cohen choked up when he spoke about his wife, Laura, and his nearly-grown children, Sami and Jake, who he said he would do anything to protect. \\\"As my father said countless times throughout my childhood, you, my wife, and you, my children, are the air that I breathe,\\\" Cohen said. Cohen detailed moments he regretted — like lying to first lady Melania Trump allegedly at the president’s direction, he said. “He asked me to pay off an adult film star with whom he had an affair and to lie about it to his wife, which I did.  And lying to the First Lady is one of my biggest regrets, because she is a kind, good person, and I respect her greatly.  And she did not deserve that,” Cohen said. Cohen cataloged times he picked up on what he claims were developments for a now-infamous Trump Tower meeting — including a chat between the president and his son, Don Jr. , who Trump allegedly said \\\"had the worst judgment of anyone in the world,\\\" according to Cohen. “What struck me as I look back and thought about the exchange between Don Jr.  and his father was, first, that Mr.  Trump had frequently told me and others that his son Don Jr.  had the worst judgment of anyone in the world, and also that Don Jr.  would never set up any meeting of significance alone, and certainly not without checking with his father,” Cohen said. “I also knew that nothing went on in Trump World, especially the campaign, without Mr.  Trump's knowledge and approval.  So I concluded that Don Jr.  was referring to that June 2016 trump tower meeting about dirt on Hillary with the Russian representatives when he walked behind his dad's desk that day,” Cohen said. Cohen closed by owning up to his past and promising not to lie, again, before members of Congress. “For those who question my motives for being here today, I understand,” Cohen said. “I have lied, but I am not a liar.  I have done bad things, but I am not a bad man.  I have fixed things, but I am no longer your fixer, Mr.  Trump.  And I am going to prison and have shattered the safety and security that I tried so hard to provide for my family,” Cohen said. A few hours before the long-anticipated hearing got underway, Merriam Webster — which has frequently spell-checked the president — offered this Tweet:\\\"Word of the Day?  Grift — to obtain money illicitly. \\\"And Dictionary. com said variations of the word \\\"collusion\\\" were trending. Here's what a top dictionary editor told ABC News in a recent story on the uptick of dictionaries chiming in during key political moments:“Paying attention to the spelling and meaning of words is a way of respecting linguistic facts, which is a requirement for serious, professional, published writing,” Peter Sokolowski, editor-at-large of Merriam-Webster, told ABC News.  \\\"Before we can come to a consensus on the meaning of ideas, we need to come to a consensus on the meaning of the words that express those ideas,\\\" he added. The hearing kicked off with a move by Republicans, led by Meadows, a Trump ally, to postpone the hearing because Cohen’s testimony was not delivered 24-hours ahead of time – a procedural sticking point that Republicans said proved Cohen wasn't following the rules. \\\"It was an intentional effort by this witness and his advisors to once again show his disdain for this body,\\\" Meadows said. Democrats, who acknowledged Cohen's scarred history and upcoming prison time, sought to give Cohen a platform to share his side of the story with the country.  Republicans repeatedly called on Cohen's history of lying to Congress – one of the crimes he is going to prison for – as proof that he could not be taken at his word. The hearing continued after a vote, which fell along party lines and gave the majority to the Democrats. \\\"You've made it clear that you do not want the American people to hear what Mr.  Cohen has to say, but the American people have a right to hear him.  So we're going to proceed.  The American people can judge his credibility for themselves,\\\" Democratic Chairman Rep.

The resolution was adopted as 24 countries voted in favour of it while nine opposed it at the end of an all-day special session of the 47-member UN body at its headquarters in Geneva on Thursday. According to official details, India abstained from voting together with 13 other member nations of the grouping.  China and Russia were among those voting in favour. \\\"The Human Rights Council this afternoon adopted a resolution on ensuring respect for international human rights law and international humanitarian law in the occupied Palestinian territory, including East Jerusalem, and in Israel,\\\" the UN body said in a statement. It said the international commission of inquiry has been established to investigate violations of international humanitarian law and all alleged violations and abuses of international human rights during the recent conflict. The special session of the Council was called to discuss the “grave human rights situation\\\" in the Palestinian territory including East Jerusalem. India's permanent representative to the UN in Geneva Indra Mani Pandey said at the special session that New Delhi welcomes the diplomatic efforts of the international community and regional countries that have resulted in bringing ceasefire between Israel and armed groups in Gaza. \\\"India calls on all parties to show extreme restraint, desist from actions that aggravate tensions and refrain from any further attempts to unilaterally change the existing status-quo, including in East Jerusalem and its neighbourhoods,\\\" he said. In a statement, Pandey also expressed concern at the continuing violence in Jerusalem, especially at Haram Al Sharif and other Palestinian territories. \\\"We remain concerned about the continuing violence in Jerusalem, especially at Haram Al Sharif/Temple Mount and other Palestinian territories, and about the possible eviction process in Sheikh Jarrah and Silwan neighbourhoods in East Jerusalem,\\\" he said. Pandey said the indiscriminate rocket firings from Gaza targeting the civilian population in Israel, and the retaliatory airstrikes into Gaza have caused immense sufferings. \\\"We deeply mourn the loss of civilian lives resulting from the violence, and urge the international community's immediate attention to providing humanitarian assistance to the Palestinian civilian population, particularly in Gaza,\\\" he said. \\\"India continues to provide developmental and humanitarian assistance to the Palestinian Authority, including COVID-19 related assistance, bilaterally, and through our dedicated contribution to the UN,\\\" he added. Both Israel and Hamas agreed on a ceasefire that has come into effect on last Friday after 11 days of intense fighting in which around 230 people were killed in Gaza and 12 in Israel. Pandey said India was firmly convinced that dialogue remains the only viable option that can effectively address the issues confronting the region and its people. \\\"Recent developments have once again underscored the need for immediate resumption of dialogue between Israel and Palestine, aimed at realising the establishment of two States living side by side in peace within secure and recognised borders,\\\" he said.  \",\"document_ocr\":\"SATUMEW JAYATHE\\nHIGH COURT OF KERALA\\n\",\"Category\":\"Insufficient_Text\"},{\"Id\":34924,\"claim_image\":\"http://pbs.twimg.com/media/Edyl2IAUwAAa8jS.jpg?format=jpg&name=large\",\"claim\":\"Floods ravage Bihar, Assam; rain causes landslips in Sikkim\\n\\nhttps://t.co/PJtVjEX3QI https://t.co/iyD6bD9CM6\",\"claim_ocr\":\"\",\"document_image\":\"http://pbs.twimg.com/media/EdaDX2LUcAA2lQ6.jpg?format=jpg&name=large\",\"document\":\"Floods caused due to heavy rainfall continue to wreak havoc in districts of Assam and Bihar while incessant rainfall in remote villages of North Sikkim has caused landslides cutting them off from other parts of the state.

In Raha area of Nagaon district of Assam, several schools, water supply project and other government buildings have been submerged in the floodwaters, officials said.  Meanwhile, the Indian Air Force (IAF) choppers on Saturday carried out relief operations in three of Bihar’s worst affected districts—Darbhanga, Gopalganj and East Champaran.  Besides the three major districts like Gopalganj, East Champaran and Darbhanga, Sitamarhi, Sheohar, Supaul, Kishanganj, Muzaffarpur, West Champaran and Khagaria are also facing the devastation due to floods of various scales, officials said. The Bihar Disaster Management Department Authority (BDMDA) principal secretary Pratyaya Amrit on Saturday said that around 10 lakh people have been affected due to the floods in the state and the Darbhanga district is the worst affected.  He added that there has been a slight reduction in the water levels across the state and around one lakh people have been evacuated. Deputy chief minister Sushil Modi said that each flood-affected person would be given Rs 6,000 each as relief from the government.  “Compensation for loss of standing crops would be announced after the assessment.  Farmers would be provided seeds for alternative crops to offset the losses,” said Modi. Over half a dozen monuments, heritage sites and ancient temples, located in flood affected districts in northern part of the state, have been inundated by flood water.  The Ashokan pillar at Lauria in West Champaran, the Buddhist stupa at Kesaria in East Champaran and the remains of the fortification of ancient ruler Raja Bali at Balirajgarh in Madhubani district have been inundated, officials said.  HS Naik, superintending archaeologist of the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), Patna circle, said the ASI has taken the matter seriously.  “Soon after the flood water recedes from Champaran and Kesaria stupa site, we will send our engineer to assess the damage and also to draft the strategies to keep the monuments and sites safe,” he said.  Meteorologist Ravindra Kumar said, “Bihar is likely to receive heavy rains after July 26.  Widespread rain with greater intensity is likely to hit entire Bihar on July 27 and 28.  A yellow category warning for heavy to very heavy rain coupled with thunderstorm and lightning has been issued for North Bihar and several parts of south-western districts. ”Separately, an Indian Air Force (IAF) helicopter on Saturday airlifted essential commodities for the people of two remote villages in North Sikkim, which are cut off from other parts of the state due to landslides, an official release said. The MI-17 helicopter carried out three sorties and dropped essential supplies comprising 100 bags of rice weighing 50 quintals each, 550 litres of cooking oil, 1. 5 quintals of salt, 100 packets of candles and matches and medicines among others for the people of Sakyong and Pentong villages of North Sikkim, the release said. The two villages are cut-off from the nearest town Dzongu since July 10 last as multiple landslides had washed off roads and bridges connecting these villages due to incessant rainfall.

Moments that mattered from Cohen's hearingMichael Cohen, a longtime confidante of the president, his former personal attorney and fixer, arrived on Capitol Hill on Wednesday to share publicly, for the first time, his side of the story. Cohen's fiery testimony, a written version of which was released to ABC News and other news outlets earlier, alleged that President Donald Trump is a \\\"racist,\\\" a \\\"conman\\\" and a \\\"cheat\\\" – and promised documents to back up Cohen's claims. Here are some of the notable moments from the hearing. In his closing remarks, Cohen said his loyalty to Trump \\\"cost him everything. \\\"\\\"I will not sit back, say nothing and allow him to do the same for the country,\\\" he said. He then ran down a list of policy decisions he's seen over the past two years and denounced them all, ticking through criticisms Trump often receives from the other side of the aisle.  Don't \\\"demonize those looking to America for a better life,\\\" Cohen said, and \\\"don't shut down the government before Christmas and New Years just to please your base. \\\"He maintained that he hoped the country would be better off with more of the truth, but warned that there were challenging times to come. \\\"I fear that if [Trump] loses the election in 2020, there will never be a peaceful transition of power,\\\" he said. Ranking member Rep.  Jim Jordan, the Republican from Ohio and a Trump ally who was sharply critical of Cohen throughout the testimony, closed with a warning that Cohen, who is going to prison in two months for charges that include lying to Congress, was not a credible witness. Democratic Rep.  Elijah Cummings, the chair of the committee, spoke last. \\\"I've sat here and I listened to all of this and it's very painful,\\\" he said.  \\\"One of the saddest parts of this whole thing is that some very innocent people are hurting too. \\\" Cohen grew emotional at the mention of his family. Cummings ended on a note of hope. \\\"Hopefully this portion of your destiny will lead to a better . . .  Michael Cohen, a better Donald Trump, a better United States of America, and a better world. \\\"In a moment that required no response from the witness, two members of Congress waded into contentious waters over allegations of racism. Tlaib, one of the last members of Congress to speak, began her time by making the point that Trump is not clear of allegations of being a racist because he had a black woman – Lynne Patton, an official at the Department of Housing and Urban Development who supports Trump and attended as Meadow's guest – as an employee. Tlaib continued: \\\"The fact that someone would even use a prop, a black woman, in this chamber, in this committee, is alone racist in itself. \\\"Meadows immediately objected, calling for her comments to be struck from the record and defending his record of civil rights advocacy.  \\\"My nieces and nephews are people of color.  Not many people know that.  You know that Mr.  Chairman,\\\" Meadows added. Tlaib reread her statement and clarified that she did not intend to call Meadows a racist.  \\\"As a person of color, that's how I felt at that moment and I wanted to express that.  I'm saying it is a racist act,\\\" she said. Cummings jumped in to mitigate the conflict between the freshman Democrat and the senior Republican, speaking as the chair of the committee, the son of sharecroppers, and -- a fact that he said surprises people -- as a very close friend of Meadows. \\\"I can see and feel your pain.  I feel it.  And I don't think Ms.  Tlaib intended to cause you that -- that kind of pain and that kind of frustration. \\\"Questions about his family, who Cohen said he caused \\\"tremendous, tremendous pain,\\\" have led to some of the more emotional moments of his testimony. But there has also been combative frustration – when Republican Rep.  Jim Jordan accused him of not owning up to his crimes, Cohen adamantly pushed back. \\\"Shame on you, Mr.  Jordan.

And lying to the First Lady is one of my biggest regrets, because she is a kind, good person, and I respect her greatly.  And she did not deserve that,” Cohen said. Cohen cataloged times he picked up on what he claims were developments for a now-infamous Trump Tower meeting — including a chat between the president and his son, Don Jr. , who Trump allegedly said \\\"had the worst judgment of anyone in the world,\\\" according to Cohen. “What struck me as I look back and thought about the exchange between Don Jr.  and his father was, first, that Mr.  Trump had frequently told me and others that his son Don Jr.  had the worst judgment of anyone in the world, and also that Don Jr.  would never set up any meeting of significance alone, and certainly not without checking with his father,” Cohen said. “I also knew that nothing went on in Trump World, especially the campaign, without Mr.  Trump's knowledge and approval.  So I concluded that Don Jr.  was referring to that June 2016 trump tower meeting about dirt on Hillary with the Russian representatives when he walked behind his dad's desk that day,” Cohen said. Cohen closed by owning up to his past and promising not to lie, again, before members of Congress. “For those who question my motives for being here today, I understand,” Cohen said. “I have lied, but I am not a liar.  I have done bad things, but I am not a bad man.  I have fixed things, but I am no longer your fixer, Mr.  Trump.  And I am going to prison and have shattered the safety and security that I tried so hard to provide for my family,” Cohen said. A few hours before the long-anticipated hearing got underway, Merriam Webster — which has frequently spell-checked the president — offered this Tweet:\\\"Word of the Day?  Grift — to obtain money illicitly. \\\"And Dictionary. com said variations of the word \\\"collusion\\\" were trending. Here's what a top dictionary editor told ABC News in a recent story on the uptick of dictionaries chiming in during key political moments:“Paying attention to the spelling and meaning of words is a way of respecting linguistic facts, which is a requirement for serious, professional, published writing,” Peter Sokolowski, editor-at-large of Merriam-Webster, told ABC News.  \\\"Before we can come to a consensus on the meaning of ideas, we need to come to a consensus on the meaning of the words that express those ideas,\\\" he added. The hearing kicked off with a move by Republicans, led by Meadows, a Trump ally, to postpone the hearing because Cohen’s testimony was not delivered 24-hours ahead of time – a procedural sticking point that Republicans said proved Cohen wasn't following the rules. \\\"It was an intentional effort by this witness and his advisors to once again show his disdain for this body,\\\" Meadows said. Democrats, who acknowledged Cohen's scarred history and upcoming prison time, sought to give Cohen a platform to share his side of the story with the country.  Republicans repeatedly called on Cohen's history of lying to Congress – one of the crimes he is going to prison for – as proof that he could not be taken at his word. The hearing continued after a vote, which fell along party lines and gave the majority to the Democrats. \\\"You've made it clear that you do not want the American people to hear what Mr.  Cohen has to say, but the American people have a right to hear him.  So we're going to proceed.  The American people can judge his credibility for themselves,\\\" Democratic Chairman Rep.  Elijah Cummings said. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events\",\"document_ocr\":\"abc\\nNEWS\\n\",\"Category\":\"Insufficient_Text\"},{\"Id\":34928,\"claim_image\":\"http://pbs.twimg.com/media/Ed-cPR-UcAEBk0p.png?format=jpg&name=large\",\"claim\":\"#COVID19 | Least active cases since June 1 in Delhi, 42% more beds than a month ago\\n\\n(report by @AnonnaDutt)  \\n\\nhttps://t.co/ep82ZArFbl https://t.co/qjinzGHR8r\",\"claim_ocr\":\"\",\"document_image\":\"http://pbs.twimg.com/media/EajlaWpUwAA44Tt.jpg?format=jpg&name=large\",\"document\":\" The national capital now has a little less than 11,000 active cases of Covid-19, a number that is the lowest since June 1, according to data from Sunday that also shows how Delhi now has the 42% more beds than it had a month ago, suggesting it was amply prepared in case of a resurgence of cases.  According data released by the Delhi government in the past 45 days, the 10,994 active cases as on Sunday is roughly two-fifths of what it was on June 26 (27,657).  Click here for full Covid-19 coverageOn that day a month ago, the capital was in the middle of what is now believed to be a peak since surmounted.  The number of new cases on June 26 was 3,460 and they represented 16% of those tested on that day, a number that is also known as the test positivity rate.  On Sunday, the positivity rate was 5. 32%. Monday’s health bulletin released by the Delhi government also showed that less than a fifth of the hospital beds earmarked for treatment of Covid-19 patients was being utilised, with only 2,835 people being shown as hospitalised.  Also read: Global recoveries hit 10 million even as Covid-19 rages onThe city currently has 15,451 beds earmarked for Covid-19 in various government, private and makeshift field hospitals.  Of these, 2,095 beds are intensive care units, which had a 36% occupancy as on Monday evening, according to the Delhi Corona App.  The 2,835 beds account for 18. 35% of the state’s capacity, a number that is well under the 33% targeted occupancy rate by the Delhi government.  Last week, health minister Satyendar Jain said the government’s plan was to ensure that the city had thrice the number of hospital beds as active infections ready for surge preparedness.  “We cannot decide what to do based on a seven or 10 days’ trend.  Today, we are getting just over a 1,000 cases a day, but we do not know whether the numbers would remain there.  We are comfortable at the moment; if we scale down and then the cases start rising again, what will we do?  Scaling back up is easier said than done.  So, we need to wait and watch,” he said.  According to senior officials from Delhi’s health department, the decision is likely to come after the second round of sero-surveillance that is scheduled to be carried out between August 1 and 5.  “There is a meeting at the end of the week, where the issue of scaling back of preparations is likely to be taken up.  However, a final decision will only come by mid-August after the second round of sero-surveillance.  If the sero-surveillance shows that we are moving towards herd immunity then it will give people as well as the government some assurance,” the official, who asked not to be named, said.  A serological survey involves randomised sampling of people from whom blood is collected to check for antibodies to the Sars-Cov-2, which would indicate how many people may have been infected and silently recovered – and thus immune to the disease for the time being.  Also read: Delhi’s recovery road, as seen in Sunday numbersDelhi’s first round of sero-surveillance, for which around 22,000 samples were collected between June 27 and July 5, found that almost 23% of the city’s residents had antibodies.  Herd immunity is the level of immunity prevalence that causes an outbreak to die out as the virus fails to find enough new vulnerable hosts.  Doctors have flagged the low occupancy in hospitals as a factor that could be hitting health care facilities for people with diseases other than Covid-19. “Lok Nayak and GTB hospitals, both of which have been converted into Covid treatment facilities, are the biggest hospitals under the Delhi government catering to thousands of patients.  Right now, both remain under-utilised and the patients undergoing treatment at these hospitals continue to await their turn.  The government needs to maintain a buffer of beds in case there is a surge in Covid cases again, but they should start looking at moving towards normal,” said a doctor from 2,000-bed Lok Nayak hospital, Delhi’s biggest treatment Covid-19 centre, while asking not to be named The drop in number of hospitalisations has been in tandem with a fall in the number of new cases.  On Monday, Delhi recorded just 613 new cases of Covid-19, lowest since May 26.  The number is lower due to fewer tests being done over the weekend but the proportion of tests that turned positive – around 5. 3% -- was consistent with what has been seen over the past week.  The average positivity rate – the percentage of people who test positive among those tested – has reduced to 6. 24% in the week ending on July 26, as compared to 7. 61% the week before, and 8. 96 the week before that.  Dr Abhishek Shankar, assistant professor of oncology at Lady Hardinge Medical College, said that there will be an “adverse and irreversible impact” on cancer treatment of about 1. 5 million patients.  “On average, treatment for cancer lasts anywhere between three to fifteen months.  As per ICMR data, India’s annual cancer burden is about 15 lakh people.  With the lockdown and all non-Covid-19 services being hampered March onwards, the treatment of all these people would have suffered.  The treatment of Covid and other ailments should not have been mutually exclusive, but if you see an institute like National Cancer Centre has been completely converted for treatment of Covid-19.  Plus, if there are Covid-19 patients in a hospital, immunocompromised cancer patients would understandably want to stay away. ” \",\"document_ocr\":\"ONY\\nANI\\nGREEN LCUNGE\\nGREEN LOUNGE\\nBANQUETS\\n\",\"Category\":\"Insufficient_Text\"},{\"Id\":34929,\"claim_image\":\"http://pbs.twimg.com/media/D2cqwXfWsAIxkaI.jpg?format=jpg&name=large\",\"claim\":\"Attorney General William Barr has submitted to Congress his summary of the main conclusions from special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation. https://t.co/jJ7I8L3jyn https://t.co/Fg4J6unrHj\",\"claim_ocr\":\"JUSTICE\\nNO\\n\",\"document_image\":\"http://pbs.twimg.com/media/D2c6qlqXcAA8Sv9.jpg?format=jpg&name=large\",\"document\":\"The report doesn't conclude Trump committed a crime and doesn't exonerate him.  Special counsel report delivered, focus shifts to attorney generalSpecial counsel Robert Mueller's report into the Kremlin's interference in the 2016 presidential election  did not find that the Trump campaign or anyone associated with it conspired or coordinated with Russia, according to a letter to Congress from Attorney General William Barr. The letter describes \\\"two main\\\" Russian efforts to influence the election  including “attempts by a Russian organization… to conduct disinformation and social media operations in the United States” and “the Russian government’s efforts to conduct computer hacking operations” targeting former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign and the Democratic Party. In both circumstances, the “Special Counsel did not find that the Trump campaign, or anyone associated with it, conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in these efforts. ”The special counsel’s office made no conclusion on the matter of possible obstruction of justice by President Donald Trump. \\\"The Special Counsel, therefore, did not draw a conclusion – one way or the other – as to whether the examined conduct constituted obstruction,\\\" the letter read.  \\\"Instead, for each of the relevant actions investigated, the report sets out 'difficult issues' of law and fact concerning whether the President's actions and intent could be viewed as obstruction. \\\"In his communique to lawmakers, Barr underscored that the special counsel states that “while this report does not conclude that the president committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him. ”While Mueller’s report did not reach a conclusion as to whether obstruction of justice occurred, Attorney General Barr’s letter said he determined a case for obstruction was not warranted. “In cataloging the President’s actions many of which took place in public view, the report identities no actions that, in our judgment, constitute obstructive conduct, had a nexus to a pending or contemplated proceeding, and were done with corrupt intent, each of which, under the Department's principles of federal prosecution guiding charging decisions, would need to be proven beyond a reasonable doubt to establish an obstruction-of-justice offense. \\\"Barr said his intent is to release as much as possible but there are grand jury secrecy concerns with some portions. The White House celebrated the news, with President Donald Trump hailing the report on Twitter and, later in comments to reporters, as an \\\"exoneration. \\\"\\\"This was an illegal takedown that failed and hopefully, someone is going to be looking at the other side,\\\" Trump told reporters on Sunday. He tweeted: \\\"No Collusion, No Obstruction, Complete and Total EXONERATION.  KEEP AMERICA GREAT! \\\"\\\"The Special Counsel did not find any collusion and did not find any obstruction,\\\" White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said in a statement.  \\\"Attorney General Barr and Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein further determined there was no obstruction.  The findings of the Department of Justice are a total and complete exoneration of the President of the United States. ”Jay Sekulow, one of President Trump’s lawyers, told ABC News chief anchor George Stephanopoulos that the report was a \\\"complete win for the president and the American people. \\\"\\\"Not just a win. \\\" Sekulow said.  \\\"The entire basis upon which this inquiry was instituted was a concern over collusion between the Russian government and the trump campaign, Bob Mueller and the Department of Justice could not be clearer.  To have the obstruction issue even as a viable one, which it was not, there would have to be an underlying crime, which there wasn't. \\\"House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler, D-N. Y. , questioned the timing of the letter tweeting \\\"Special Counsel Mueller worked for 22 months to determine the extent to which President Trump obstructed justice.  Attorney General Barr took 2 days to tell the American people that while the President is not exonerated, there will be no action by DOJ. \\\" He later tweeted that \\\"in light of the very concerning discrepancies and final decision making at the Justice Department following the Special Counsel report,\\\" the House Judiciary Committee will be calling Barr in to testify in the near future. In his letter to members of Congress on Sunday, Barr described the breadth of the special counsel’s extensive and exhaustive probe.  Mueller’s 19 prosecutors and 40 FBI agents issued more than 2,800 subpoenas, executed nearly 500 search warrants, and interviewed approximately 500 witnesses, Barr wrote, the results of which amounted to 37 indictments and six guilty pleas to date. The news comes amid Democrats continued calls for the full release of the findings. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, in a joint letter, seemed to sum up the sentiment of many congressional Democrats in saying that Barr's letter \\\"raises as many questions as it answers\\\" and that Congress \\\"requires the full report and the underlying documents. \\\"\\\"The fact that Special Counsel Mueller’s report does not exonerate the president on a charge as serious as obstruction of justice demonstrates how urgent it is that the full report and underlying documentation be made public without any further delay,\\\" they wrote.  \\\"Given Mr.  Barr’s public record of bias against the Special Counsel’s inquiry, he is not a neutral observer and is not in a position to make objective determinations about the report. \\\"The congressional leaders also took issues with the president's claims of being \\\"exonerated. \\\"On the campaign trail and on the Hill, Democrats made clear they are going to want every detail and document about the investigation and some have said they are willing to use their subpoena power in order to get it. \\\"It means make the request, if the request is denied subpoena, if the subpoenas are denied we will hold people before the Congress and yes, we will prosecute in court as necessary to get this information,\\\" House Intelligence Committee chairman Rep.  Adam Schiff, D-Calif. , said Sunday on \\\"This Week\\\". Democratic candidates running to unseat President Donald Trump in 2020 reacted quickly to the news that Mueller delivered his report to DOJ with one consistent message: Make it public. \\\"The Mueller report must be made public — all of it,\\\" Sen.  Kirsten Gillibrand, D-NY said in a presidential campaign speech outside the Trump International Hotel and Tower in New York City. She added: \\\"It is not often that I agree with Richard Nixon, but he was right to say that the American people have a right to know whether their president is a crook. \\\"The much-awaited report was handed to the Justice Department for Barr’s review, and Congress was notified of the transfer late Friday afternoon, according to a Justice Department spokeswoman. After reviewing Mueller's report, Barr will then send what he has described as his own \\\"report\\\" on the Mueller investigation to the top Democrats and Republicans on the House and Senate Judiciary committees.  Barr has promised to be as transparent as possible, but it's unclear how extensive or detailed Barr's own \\\"report\\\" to Congress will be. In a letter to the leaders of the House and Senate Judiciary committees, Barr wrote that he intends to \\\"consult with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and Special Counsel Mueller to determine what other information from the report can be released to Congress and the public consistent with the law. \\\"A senior Department of Justice official told ABC News on Friday that the report would not include any further indictments. Mueller and his team investigated how far the Kremlin went to interfere in the 2016 presidential election, including trying to determine whether any Americans may have helped those efforts. At the heart of Mueller’s probe were two Russian operations: the spread of disinformation on social media, and the release of thousands of sensitive emails stolen by hackers from the Democratic National Committee and other Democratic targets.  Mueller’s team has charged 25 Russian nationals and three foreign companies for their alleged role in those operations. In appointing a special counsel to investigate, however, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein also directed Mueller to look into “allegations” of possible “coordination” between Russian operatives and associates of President Donald Trump. Trump and his Republican allies have derided the investigation as a “witch hunt. ” But Rosenstein, FBI Director Chris Wray and Barr have each explicitly disputed that description. At least four Trump associates, including Trump’s former national security adviser Michael Flynn, have pleaded guilty to lying to federal agents during the Russia-related investigation. Another Trump associate, the president’s former attorney Michael Cohen, has pleaded guilty to lying to Congress about Trump’s business dealings in Moscow.  And former Trump adviser Roger Stone has been charged with lying to Congress about his alleged role in tracking information stolen from Democrats during the 2016 presidential campaign. Mueller’s investigation grew out of a probe the FBI launched in late July 2016. By then, the FBI was already scrutinizing Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort’s business dealings with pro-Russian officials in Ukraine – dealings that have since landed Manafort in jail.  And the FBI was keeping tabs on Trump adviser Carter Page, who was previously targeted for recruitment by Russian spies and had raised eyebrows with a trip to Moscow in mid-July 2016. But claims by Trump adviser George Papadopoulos – that the Russians were touting “dirt” on Clinton – really set off alarms inside the FBI. “If any Americans were part of helping the Russians [attack] us, that is a very big deal,” James Comey, who was FBI director at the time, later told lawmakers. Several weeks after formally launching the Russia probe, counterintelligence agents leading the investigation in Washington received a so-called “dossier,” which had been compiled at the behest of Democrats and detailed uncorroborated allegations of coordination between Trump’s campaign and the Kremlin. Some of the allegations involved Page, who was already on the FBI’s radar, so agents began secretly intercepting his communications.  Page has never been charged with any crimes. The wide-ranging investigation continued even after Trump took office.  After Jeff Sessions became attorney general, he recused himself from oversight of the FBI’s Russia-related probe, citing his previous advocacy for Trump on the campaign trail. Rosenstein subsequently assumed oversight of the investigation. And then Trump shocked the federal law enforcement community: He fired Comey. The move prompted Rosenstein to appoint Mueller to take over the whole matter, including a review of whether Comey's firing and other actions meant Trump improperly tried to obstruct the probe. Comey later alleged that in a private meeting with Trump before his removal, the president directed Comey to “let [Flynn] go. ”Mueller has not released any evidence suggesting Trump committed a crime related to Russian efforts. However, Mueller did uncover evidence of other possible crimes and referred those cases to other federal prosecutors. The U. S.  Attorney’s Office in Manhattan ended up tying Trump to federal campaign violations, alleging that – in the midst of the 2016 presidential campaign – Trump personally directed Cohen to silence two woman claiming affairs with Trump by making illegal payments to them; Trump has repeatedly denied the affairs. Cohen has pleaded guilty for his role in the matter, but no other charges have been filed.

Sunday morning, multiple sources familiar with the matter told ABC News that in addition to an outside political ally of Pence's, four of his staffers have tested positive.  One senior-level source stressed that the three staffers have been quarantining since the middle of this past week. Among those three staffers who tested positive and were in quarantine is Pence's \\\"body man,\\\" a position that often represents an individual who is the closest aide to the office holder. White House chief of staff Mark Meadows did not want to immediately reveal that Short and other members of staff close to the vice president had tested positive for the coronavirus, sources told ABC News. Defending this Sunday on CNN's \\\"State of the Union,\\\" Meadows said, \\\"Sharing personal information is not something that we should do, not something that we do actually do unless it's the vice president or the president or someone that is very close to them where there is people in harm's way.

We have done that. \\\"O'Malley said both Pence and wife Karen Pence tested negative for the virus on Saturday and a pool report indicated they tested negative again on Sunday morning. Pence has been crisscrossing the country on the campaign trail for weeks.  He made visits to Lakeland and Tallahassee, Florida, on Saturday.  On Friday, he spent time in his home state of Indiana, where he voted in person in Indianapolis, before holding rallies in Ohio and Pennsylvania.  He will continue his schedule, O'Malley said, despite the close contact with Short. \\\"While Vice President Pence is considered a close contact with Mr.  Short, in consultation with the White House Medical Unit, the Vice President will maintain his schedule in accordance with the CDC guidelines for essential personnel,\\\" he wrote in a statement. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advise essential workers who have been exposed to COVID-19 should take their temperature before work, wear a face mask at all times and social distance \\\"as work duties permit. \\\"Pence is scheduled to hold a rally in Kinston, North Carolina, on Sunday evening.  The vice president has also said he plans to be in the Senate on Monday for the vote on Judge Amy Coney Barrett's nomination to the Supreme Court. President Donald Trump, upon disembarking Air Force One at Joint Base Andrews, was asked about Short's positive test. \\\"I did hear about him just now and I think he's quarantining.  I did hear about him,\\\" the president said.  \\\"He's going to be fine but he's quarantining.  Thank you very much. \\\"Short has served as Pence's chief of staff since March 2019. Obst, a top political aide to the vice president, tested positive last week, multiple sources familiar with the matter told ABC News.  He is an outside adviser and not a government employee. He was spotted at a fundraiser at Trump Doral attended by both Pence and President Trump on Oct.  15.  While he was traveling with the VP last week, he wasn't in close proximity to him, sources say. Obst did not respond to a request for comment.  The vice president's office did not immediately respond. The trusted adviser, who ran Pence's campaign in 2016, has kept up a steady stream of tweets and retweets on Twitter in recent days and weeks, though he does not appear to have mentioned his own diagnosis. This is the second time someone close to Pence has tested positive for the virus.  Katie Miller, Pence's press secretary and wife of Trump adviser Stephen Miller, tested positive for COVID-19 in May.

Altobelli, known as \\\"Alto,\\\" worked at Orange Coast College for 27 years and was known to be a mentor to players, according to the school. \\\"He truly personified what it means to be a baseball coach,\\\" the school's athletic director, Jason Kehler, said in a statement.  \\\"The passion that he put into the game, but more importantly his athletes, was second to none - he treated them like family. \\\"\\\"We have lost a member of our OCC family, and our hearts are broken,\\\" the college president, Angelica Suarez, added in a statement.  \\\"Coach Altobelli was a giant on our campus - a beloved teacher, coach, colleague and friend.  This is a tremendous loss for our campus community. \\\"\\\"John Altobelli was a great coach and man,\\\" tweeted Barry Faulkner, a sportswriter at the Daily Pilot in Southern California.  \\\"I worked closely with him for more than a dozen years covering his OCC program.  Huge heart.  Great sense of humor and passion for the game, his players and his family.  RIP Alto.  Truly a legend. \\\"John Altobelli's wife, Keri Altobelli, was also on board, along with one of their daughters. They left behind 16-year-old daughter, Alexis Altobelli, and son J. J.  Altobelli, John Altobelli's son from a previous marriage. Keri Altobelli was strong, direct and bold, but also \\\"loving and extremely loyal\\\" and \\\"embraced everything her family did,\\\" her friend, Lori Lever, said at the family memorial service. \\\"As the girls grew up, their personal passions became Keri's passions.  Managing the family schedule with baseball commitments for Alto, basketball for Lyssa, tennis and academics for Lexi, supporting J. J.  as he pursued a career in baseball like his dad,\\\" Lever said.  \\\"And the demands of Keri's own business left little time for anything else. \\\"\\\"Watching her do this effortlessly was nothing short of amazing,\\\" Lever said. Their 14-year-old daughter Alyssa Altobelli was a teammate of Gianna Bryant. She was a \\\"devoted basketball player\\\" with a solid work ethic, but she also \\\"always had my back,\\\" her friend Sammy Forbath said at the memorial service. Forbath recalled when they played on the same basketball team.  Instead of taking the shot, Alyssa would pass the ball to Forbath \\\"so I could make my first,\\\" she said. \\\"And when I'd miss, she'd look at me with a smile and say, 'Good try, you'll get the next one,'\\\" Forbath said.  \\\"She always was doing her best to make people happy and make them feel good. \\\"Payton Chester, an eighth grader at St.  Margaret's Episcopal School in San Juan Capistrano, California, was killed on the flight. The 13-year-old played basketball with Gianna Bryant, ABC Los Angeles station KABC reported. \\\"She was 5 feet 11 inches tall and an exceptional basketball player,\\\" her grandmother, Catherine George, told the San Gabriel Valley Tribune.  \\\"Not only was she an athlete, she was smart and a friend to all. \\\"\\\"She was truly perfect,\\\" her uncle, Andy George, told the newspaper.  \\\"I picture Payton draining the 3-point basket to win the game on the 26th.  I picture her with the confidence to take that shot, the smile on her face when she hit it and the joy running back on defense as she celebrated with her teammates. \\\"Payton Chester's mother, Sarah Chester, was with her on the flight. Sarah Chester was on the board of trustees at her daughter's school. The 45-year-old had taught elementary school before retiring to raise her family, the San Gabriel Valley Tribune reported. She is survived by her husband and two teenage sons. Todd Schmidt, Payton Chester's former elementary school principal, said Sarah and Payton Chester \\\"were genuine, kind-hearted, and caring . . .  to the staff, to other families . . .  and yes, especially to me. \\\"\\\"While the world mourns the loss of a dynamic athlete and humanitarian, I mourn the loss of two people just as important,\\\" Schmidt wrote on Facebook.  \\\"Their impact was just as meaningful, their loss will be just as keenly felt, and our hearts are just as broken. \\\"Girls' basketball coach Christina Mauser leaves behind a husband and three young children. As a top assistant coach of the Mamba girls’ basketball team, she coached Gianna Bryant and her teammates. \\\"My wife had a brilliant, brilliant eye for coaching,\\\" Mauser's husband, Matthew Mauser, told ABC News last year.  \\\"I was so proud of her.  It was amazing watching her in her element. \\\"\\\"Kobe didn't pick my wife because she was average,\\\" he said.  \\\"She was exceptional. \\\"\\\"As good as she was with X's and O's, she was also that good with how to treat the girls,\\\" he added.  \\\"They would confide in her. \\\"May 2020 would have marked the Mausers' 15th wedding anniversary. Through tears, he told ABC News, \\\"I love my wife.  With everything I had. \\\"Ara Zobayan, 50, was the pilot. Group 3 Aviation, the California aviation company that trained him, said Zobayan first came to Group 3 in 1998 to learn how to fly helicopters after he took a sightseeing tour flight at the Grand Canyon.  Zobayan \\\"knew immediately he wanted to become a pilot,\\\" the company said. He then \\\"worked hard in other businesses to save enough money to pay for training,\\\" according to Group 3.  \\\"Flying was his life's passion. \\\"\\\"There's a reason that people wanted to fly with him,\\\" pilot Jared Yochim told CNN.  \\\"He was just a cool, calm guy. \\\"\\\"He felt he was here on Earth . . .  to fly and to teach, and to teach people to have this feeling that he had,” Darren Kemp, one of his student pilots, told The Associated Press.

Till now, J&K had a unique position among Indian states – it had its own Constitution and only a handful of laws that apply to other states were valid.  The legal provision that gave it this unique position was Article 370 of the Constitution, which the government effectively abolished by changing some of its aspect and cancelling out some others through an order. Also watch: ‘Bloodshed will end now’: HM Amit Shah on how Article 370 hurt J&K “The president on the recommendation of Parliament is pleased to declare as from 5th of August 2019, all clauses of the said Article 370 shall cease to be operative. . .  ,” said a resolution moved by home minister Amit Shah. The announcement came after days of uncertainty in the state, where the annual Amarnath Yatra that draws tens of thousands of pilgrims was abruptly called off last week while a large number of soldiers were moved.  The government had also imposed a security lockdown and cut all telecommunications in the early hours of Monday. Mixed reactionsThe decision drew angry reactions from many political parties, who said it amounted to going back on a promise that was made during the time when India got independence from the British.  Former chief minister Mehbooba Mufti said the decision reflected a desire of the Bharatiya Janata Party-led Union government to change the demography of Kashmir, where Muslims make up a majority. Her regional rival, National Conference leader Omar Abdullah said the move was “unilateral and shocking”, and a total “betrayal of trust” of the people of Jammu and Kashmir.  Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad in parliament said the government had “wiped out Jammu and Kashmir’s identity”. Some politicians, however, especially those from the BJP and their allies welcomed the decision. The historyTo understand the angry reactions, it is important to look at how the special status came into being.  During Independence and the partition of India and Pakistan, princely states – or regions that were ruled by a local leader in alliance with the British Raj – went through a process of integrating with either of the two countries. The then ruler of Jammu and Kashmir, Raja Hari Singh, decided to go with India by signing the Instrument of Accession treaty.  But, unlike most other states, the treaty set a crucial pre-condition: the local government of Jammu and Kashmir will make laws on all aspects of the state except three -- foreign relations, defence and communications. Thus, Article 370 was incorporated when India adopted its Constitution.  Subsequently, it became the basis for several privileges that were announced for people of J&K, such as restricting people from outside of the state to buy property or claim right to employment. What nowAll of these privileges will now be at par with UTs.  The Centre moved a draft law for parliament’s approval to turn J&K into one UT and Ladakh as another. For J&K, the government has proposed an assembly, which means the region will have a chief minister – but many of its crucial powers, such as those relating to police and land – will be controlled by the federal government, similar to what happens in the national capital of New Delhi. Pakistan, which claims the Kashmir region as its own, called the move illegal and said it will take “all possible steps” to counter it – the steps were not spelled out. \",\"document_ocr\":\"THIS IS THE DEATI\\nOF DEMOCRACY!\\n#STANDWITHJ&K\\nTHIS IS THE DEATH\\nOF DEMOCRACY!\\nProtest at Town\\nHall, Bangalore\\n#STANDWITHJ&K\\non Monday\\n(05-08-2019)\\nat 5 30 pm\\nProtest at Town\\nHall, Bangalore\\nat 5 30 pm\\non M y\\n(os-o\\n\",\"Category\":\"Insufficient_Text\"},{\"Id\":34936,\"claim_image\":\"http://pbs.twimg.com/media/EBSJaq8XYAA4bPl.jpg?format=jpg&name=large\",\"claim\":\"Asaduddin Owaisi in Lok Sabha: I stand to oppose the bill.

Read full article hereSo what changes for Jammu and Kashmir now? The effective scrapping of Article 370 brings Jammu and Kashmir completely under Indian law, like any other state or UT.  Under the IoA, only matters of defence, communications and external affairs were under the Centre.  In addition, the 1954 Presidential order also created Article 35A, which empowered the state to define permanent residents and provide them special rights and privileges.  Now, Article 35 stands nullified. Why was this needed? As per clause 3, Article 370 could have only been scrapped after the state’s constituent assembly recommended it.  Currently, governor Satya Pal Malik is in-charge of the state, after the ruling coalition of Peoples Democratic Party and the Bharatiya Janata Party fell in 2018.  Hence, the clause added to Article 367 ensured that the Governor could be counted as the state, on whose recommendation the new presidential order was passed. First came the presidential orderOfficially called the Constitution(Application to Jammu & Kashmir Order) 2019, and signed by President Ram Nath Kovind, the order superseded the Constitution (Application to Jammu & Kashmir Order) 1954, and included two main points:It added a clause to Article 367, which clarified that references to representative of the President, as well as the state government could be construed as references to the Governor of Jammu and KashmirThe order will supersede (Application to Jammu and Kashmir Order) 1954, effectively nullifying Article 35A, which empowered the state to define permanent residents, giving them special rights and privileges. The ‘kill switch’Clause 3 of the article stated:“The President may, by public notification, declare that this article shall cease to be operative or shall be operative only with such exceptions and modifications and from such date as he may specify:Provided that the recommendation of the Constituent Assembly of the State referred to in clause (2) shall be necessary before the President issues such a notification. ”A Constitution order signed by the President could scrap the article, but it required the state’s constituent assembly to recommend this. What’s Article 370? Introduced in the Constitution in 1949, it expanded the state’s powers: any law passed by Parliament could apply as long as they formed part of the Instrument of Accession, and only after consultation with the state government.  Over time, this article was used to include several subjects, other than defence communications and foreign affairs that the Centre could legislate on. What made J&K different? Unlike other states, it had its own penal code, and specific laws for transfer of property, inheritance, personal laws, benami transactions, RTI etc.  While several items in the Union and Concurrent lists applied to J&K, parliament needed the state to ratify them. The four matters before Upper HouseThe four matters before Upper House:Constitution (Application to Jammu and Kashmir) Order 2019 – issued by President of India to supersede the 1954 order related to Article 370.

The state of Jammu and Kashmir, which became a part of Union of India on 26 Oct 1947, through an Instrument of Accession signed by the then ruler Hari Singh, had its own Constitution and framed its own laws in all areas except defense, external affairs and communications. \",\"document_ocr\":\"DD\\nNEWS HD\\nLIVE\\n\",\"Category\":\"Insufficient_Text\"},{\"Id\":34937,\"claim_image\":\"http://pbs.twimg.com/media/D0bOgXbXQAE5pir.jpg?format=jpg&name=large\",\"claim\":\"Michael Cohen says it's possible that the entire Trump family was compromised by Russia in the months before the 2016 election https://t.co/4D2hrVPrdh https://t.co/9Ky8CHWtMv\",\"claim_ocr\":\"House Oversight Committee\\nCapitol Hill\\n11:10 AM ET\\nMR.

What we learned from Michael Cohen's House Oversight Committee testimonyMichael Cohen, President Donald Trump's former lawyer and fixer, testifed publicly for the first time Wednesday about his experience in the Trump orbit before the House Oversight Committee, painting a harsh portrait of the president as an unscrupulous businessman who may have committed a crime while in office. Cohen also repeated what he said in a copy of his prepared remarks obtained by ABC News, claiming that Trump, as a candidate, knew his longtime confidant Roger Stone was talking with Julian Assange about WikiLeaks' possibly revealing emails hacked from the Democratic National Committee. In a statement to ABC News on Wednesday morning, Stone denied Cohen's allegation.  Julian Assange attorney Barry Pollack, in a statement, said, “Roger Stone did not have the telephone call Michael Cohen described. \\\"Here is how the hearing unfolded:5:20 p. m.  – Committee chairman in closing remarks: ‘We are better than this’In a fiery and impassioned speech to close out Wednesday’s blockbuster hearing after more than seven hours, Rep.  Elijah Cummings, D-Md. , called on members of his committee to “be better” as he sympathized with Cohen’s position. “We are better than this.  We are so much—we really are.  We are so much better than this,” Cummings said, adding, “when we are dancing with the angels, the question will be asked: in 2019 what did we do? ”Cummings’ sentiment drew an emotional response from Cohen, who appeared to be holding back tears when the chairman invoked the harm Cohen’s actions has caused his family. When he finished, Cummings pounded his gavel and adjourned the hearing more than seven hours after gaveling it in. 5:05 p. m.  – Cohen: If Trump loses 2020 election, 'I fear' there won’t be a peaceful transition of powerIn a dramatic statement at the conclusion of Wednesday’s hearing, Michael Cohen made a startling prediction: If President Trump fails to win a reelection bid in 2020, he may not give up his grip on power. “Given my experience working for President Trump, I fear that if he loses the election in 2020 that there will never be a peaceful transition of power,” Cohen said.  “This is why I agreed to appear before you today. ”Cohen then called on President Trump to cease attacks on the media, Gold Star families, and others. “You don't vilify people based on the god they pray to and you don't cuddle up to our adversaries at the expense of our allies,” Cohen said.  “You don't shut down to appease your base.  This behavior the office of the president and it simply is un-American. ”4:55 p. m.  – Democrat accuses GOP committee member of 'racist act'Rep.  Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich. , accused a Republican colleague of using a “black woman as a prop” during Wednesday’s testimony, sparking uproar from Republicans on the committee and calls for her comments to be stricken from the record. Tlaib’s statement came in response to Rep.  Mark Meadows, R-N. C. , inviting Lynne Patton, a current Department of Housing and Urban Development official and former longtime Trump Organization employee, to Wednesday’s hearing.  Meadows asked to include Patton’s statement defending Trump against accusations that he is “a racist” into the record.  Patton is a black woman. Meadows took issue with Tlaib’s remarks, offering an emotional rebuttal and defending his record of advocating civil rights for racial minorities. Tlaib clarified that she does not believe Meadows is a racist but accused him of “a racist act. ”4:45 p. m.  – Rep.  Ocasio-Cortez questions Cohen over Trump golf coursesIn a line of questioning by Rep.  Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N. Y. , Michael Cohen described how he said Donald Trump sought to garner tax deductions by reducing the value of his golf properties. Asked how the president did so, Cohen said, “you deflate the value of the asset and put in a request to the tax department for a deduction. ”Rep.  Ocasio-Cortez cited a lengthy New York Times article published in October describing “dubious tax schemes” Trump engaged in during the 1990s. 4:27 p. m.  – Hearing resumes after lengthy recessAfter a nearly two hour break -- an hour longer than stated -- members of the committee and Michael Cohen have returned to their seats for the final leg of questioning.  Overall, Cohen seems to have fended off most Republican attacks on him so far by taking a non-combative approach and repeatedly asserting that while he's lied previously, he's telling the truth now. 2:30 p. m.  – Stormy Daniels weighs in: ‘Michael, I’m proud of you’Shortly before the committee took what was expected to about an hour break for lunch, the adult film actress at the heart of president’s hush money payments controversy released a statement during Cohen’s testimony, saying she’s “proud” of Cohen for “finally beginning to tell the truth about what you did. ”Stormy Daniels, whose name has been repeatedly invoked over the course of Wednesday’s hearing for her role as the recipient of a hush money payment, appeared moved by Cohen’s testimony. “I can hear the pain and regret you feel for betraying your family and your country,” she said.  “Thank you for having the courage, at long last, to begin to tell the truth. ”Cohen executed the $130,000 payment to Daniels prior to the 2016 election.  President Trump has denied having an affair with Daniels. 2:10 p. m.  – Cohen describes plans to have Trump visit Russia during campaignMichael Cohen described negotiations he said he conducted with Trump campaign manager Cory Lewandowski “early on in the campaign” to have Trump visit Russia to “take a look” at the Trump Tower in Moscow project. Cohen and Lewandowski discussed the “possibility of which dates that Mr.  Trump would have availability if, in fact, that we were going to go over to Russia to take a look at the project. ”In November, Cohen pleaded guilty to lying to Congress about whether Trump and his company had pursued the Moscow real estate project while Trump was securing the GOP nomination in 2016. Cohen said the visit “never came to fruition because we were never successful in getting … ownership or control over a piece of property. ”1:45 p. m.  – Cohen contradicts Steele dossier, says he has never been to PragueMichael Cohen insisted under oath on Wednesday that he has never been to Prague or the Czech Republic, a central allegation in the dossier former MI-6 agent Christopher Steele compiled as opposition research. The dossier describes an incident in August 2016 in which Cohen allegedly traveled to Prague to meet with Russians.  Buzzfeed News posted the dossier in January 2017. Cohen has denied this claim in the past, including during an interview with ABC News. “I’ve never actually walked the land in Prague,” Cohen told ABC News.  “And last August I was not in Prague. ”1:25 p. m.  – Cohen says Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner’s attorney ‘reviewed’ his letter to Congress, tooAbbe Lowell, the attorney who represents the president's daughter and son-in-law, Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner, also reviewed Michael Cohen’s letter to Congress in 2017 that ultimately became the basis for charges Cohen lied to Congress, Cohen said Wednesday. They were not immediately available for comment. Cohen said earlier that Jay Sekulow, one of President Trump’s lawyers, made changes and additions to Cohen's statement, and mentioned that others may have, too. Late Wednesday afternoon, Sekulow issued a statement saying, “Today’s testimony by Michael Cohen that attorneys for the President edited or changed his statement to Congress to alter the duration of the Trump Tower Moscow negotiations is completely false. \\\"In his opening statement on Wednesday, Cohen said one of “Mr.  Trump’s personal lawyers reviewed and edited my statement to Congress about the timing of the Moscow Tower negotiations before I gave it. ”Cohen pleaded guilty in November to lying to Congress about whether Trump and his company had pursued the Moscow real estate project while Trump was securing the GOP nomination in 2016. 1:20 p. m.  – Cohen says Trump called him to coordinate messaging -- effectively lie -- about whether he knew about hush money paymentsMichael Cohen said during testimony on Wednesday that President Trump sought to coordinate public messaging about hush money payments to Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal in February 2018.  The women claim to have had affairs with Trump that he has denied. Trump instructed Cohen to say “he was not knowledgeable of the reimbursements and he wasn't knowledgeable of my actions,” Cohen said, referring to the hush money payments. Trump publicly denied knowledge of the payments before his attorney, Rudy Giuliani, confirmed later – in May 2018 – that Trump reimbursed Cohen for the $130,000 payment to Daniels. 1:00 p. m.  – Cohen says Trump lawyer Jay Sekulow made changes to his false statement to CongressMichael Cohen said one of President Trump’s lawyers, Jay Sekulow, made changes and additions to Cohen's statement to Congress in 2017 that ultimately became the basis for charges Cohen lied to Congress. In his opening statement on Wednesday, Cohen said one of “Mr.  Trump’s personal lawyers reviewed and edited my statement to Congress about the timing of the Moscow Tower negotiations before I gave it. ”He later identified that lawyer as Sekulow, who he said made “several changes … including how we were going to handle that message which was … the message, of course, being the length of time that the Trump Tower Moscow project stayed and remained alive. ”Sekulow has not addressed Cohen's claim. Cohen pleaded guilty in November to lying to Congress about whether Trump and his company had pursued the Moscow real estate project while Trump was securing the GOP nomination in 2016. 12:40 p. m.  – Cohen: Aware of another 'illegal act' Trump has committed, says SDNY investigatingMichael Cohen teased another “wrongdoing or illegal act” he claimed President Trump has committed, but said he could not give details because of an ongoing investigation headed by federal prosecutors in the Southern District of New York. Asked by Rep.  Raja Krishnamoorthi, D-Ill. , whether there is “any other wrongdoing or illegal act that you are aware of regarding Donald Trump that we haven't yet discussed today,” Cohen replied he was aware. “Yes,” he said, “and again, those are part of the investigation that's currently being looked at by the Southern District of New York. ”Cohen added that he is in “constant contact with the Southern District of New York regarding ongoing investigations. ”Outside the hearing room, SDNY had no comment. 12:30 p. m.  – Cohen to GOP: ‘Not one question so far has been about Mr.  Trump’In response to questions from Rep.  Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, Cohen called out Republicans on the panel for asking only about him and not President Trump. “I just find it interesting, sir, that between yourself and your colleagues, not one question so far since I'm here has been asked about President Trump,” Cohen said.  “That's actually why I thought I was coming today – not to confess the mistakes that I've made.  I've already done that. “The American people don't care about my taxes,” Cohen said.  “They want to know what it is that I know about Mr.  Trump, and not one question so far has been asked about Mr.  Trump. \\\"12:10 p. m.  – Cohen describes 'several factors' that led him to turn on TrumpAsked what caused him to turn on his longtime boss and effectively testify against him, Michael Cohen dramatically ticked off a list of Trump's actions and statements that led him to speak out. “Helsinki, Charlottesville, watching the daily destruction of our civility to one another, putting up with silly things like this,” Cohen said.  “It’s really unbecoming of Congress. ”Cohen said he used to protect Trump the way Republican members of the House Oversight Committee are protecting the president at Wednesday’s hearing. “I'm responsible for your silliness because I did the same thing that you're doing now for ten years,” Cohen said.  “I protected Mr.  Trump for ten years … I can only warn people the more people that follow Mr.  Trump, as I did blindly, are going to suffer the same consequences that I'm suffering. ”12:02 p. m.  – Cohen rejects accusation he’s trying to get a reduction in sentenceMichael Cohen denied a claim that his appearance is part of an effort to earn a reduction in his prison sentence. Asked by Rep.  Paul Gosar, R-Ariz. , whether his testimony could result in a reduction in his three-year sentence, Cohen said “it’s a possibility,” but rejected the notion that it is his purpose for testifying publicly before the House Oversight Committee. “I'm not sure how my appearance here today is providing substantial information that the Southern District can use for the creation of a case,” Cohen said, before joking, “Now if there is something that this group can do for me, I would gladly welcome it. ”Cohen is scheduled to report to prison on May 6. 12:00 p. m.  – Cohen describes Trump’s involvement in Trump Tower Moscow projectShortly before Michael Cohen asked for a break, he described what he said was the extent of Trump’s involvement in the Trump Tower Moscow negotiations during the campaign. “After each communication that I had [about the Trump Tower Moscow project], I would report back to [Trump] and our goal was to get this project,” Cohen said.  “We were interested in building what would have been the largest building in all of Europe. ”In his opening statement, Cohen said Trump remained directly involved in negotiations and often asked Cohen, “How’s it going in Russia? ”In November, Cohen pleaded guilty to lying to Congress about whether Trump and his company had pursued a Moscow real estate project while he was securing the GOP nomination in 2016. 11:45 a. m.  – Cohen pressed on his claim Trump is 'a racist'Rep.  Mark Meadows, R-N. C. , invited a guest to appear during his questioning of Cohen. Lynne Patton, a current Department of Housing and Urban Development official and former longtime Trump Organization employee, stood behind Meadows as he questioned Cohen about his allegation that Trump is “a racist. ”Meadows put a statement from Patton defending Trump into the record and asked Cohen to reconcile his claim with her defense of Trump as an African-American woman and the daughter of a man who grew up in Birmingham, Alabama. Cohen shot back by pointing out that he stands by his testimony as the son of a Holocaust survivor, prompting audible \\\"oohs\\\" from onlookers inside the hearing room. 11:30 a. m.  – Cohen hits back: 'Shame on you, Mr.  Jordan'Cohen, who once called himself Donald Trump’s “attack dog,” unleashed a heated rebuke of the ranking Republican on the committee, Rep.  Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, during a debate over whether Cohen accepted his guilt. Jordan read a quote the December indictment of Cohen written by federal prosecutors in the Southern District of New York.  It said Cohen’s “consciousness of wrongdoing is fleeting, his instinct to blame others is strong,” and accused Cohen of failing to appropriately show remorse for his actions. Cohen took issue with that characterization. “Shame on you, Mr.  Jordan,” Cohen said.  “That's not what I said.  What I said is, I took responsibility and I take responsibility … I am remorseful and I am going to prison. \\\"Cohen is scheduled to report to prison on May 6 to serve a three-year sentence. 11:12 a. m.  – Cohen says Trump and his children were ‘compromised’ by RussiaDuring a line of questioning about WikiLeaks’ release of internal Democrat National Committee and Hillary Clinton campaign emails, Cohen said he believes President Trump and his children may have been “conflicted or compromised” by Russia during the 2016 presidential campaign. He stopped short of characterizing the campaign’s alleged knowledge of the impending release of hacked Democrats’ emails as “collusion,” but said there was “something odd. ”\\\"As I stated in my testimony, I wouldn't use the word colluding,\\\" Cohen said.  Was there something odd about the back and forth praise with President Putin?  Yes.  But I'm not really sure that I can answer that question in terms of collusion. \\\"In his opening statement, Cohen claimed that Trump, as a candidate, knew his longtime political confidant Roger Stone was talking with Julian Assange about WikiLeaks' revealing of emails from prominent Democrats. 11:05 a. m.  – Cohen denies any desire to work in the White HouseRep.  Jim Jordan of Ohio, the ranking Republican on the committee and first to question Cohen, accused Cohen of acting in defiance of President Trump because he was upset at not getting a position in the White House after Trump’s election. Cohen categorically denied the allegation. “Mr.  Jordan, all I wanted was what I got, to be personal attorney to the president,” Cohen said. Cohen described an incident in which Trump \\\"reamed out\\\" former White House chief of staff Reince Priebus because Cohen hadn't gotten a job in the White House Counsel's office. 10:55 a. m.  – Questioning begins with an inquiry into hush money paymentsAfter Cohen’s 30-minute opening statement, the questioning portion of Wednesday’s hearing is underway. Rep.  Cummings, as committee chairman, began with a line of questioning about the hush money payments Cohen made to adult film actress Stormy Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, and his reimbursement by Trump. “The president said he knew nothing of these favors,” Cummings said.  “Based on your conversations with him, is there any doubt in your mind that President Trump knew exactly what he was paying for? ”“There is no doubt in my mind and I truly believe there is no doubt in the people of the United States of America,” Cohen said. Cohen presented a copy of a check Trump allegedly wrote, after taking office, to reimburse Cohen for the hush-money payment. Outside the hearing room, the Trump Organization responded that Donald Trump Jr.  had \\\"no concept/idea\\\" that he was signing a check to reimburse Cohen for the Stormy Daniels hush money payment.  Donald Trump Jr.  signed the $35,000 check as a trustee of the Donald J.  Trump Revocable Trust. President Trump has denied having an affair with Daniels. 10:42 a. m.  – Michael Cohen shares regrets, shame for a decade of work for Trump“And yet I continued working for him. ”That’s the refrain Michael Cohen is repeating after each damning anecdote he offers about President Trump.  Cohen’s opening statement included repeated mentions of how \\\"ashamed\\\" he feels now about his work for Trump. “I am ashamed because I know what Mr.  Trump is,” Cohen said. Cohen described with remorse the threatening letters he wrote on Trump’s behalf and the bidding he did for a man he called “a racist,” “a conman,” and “a cheat. ”“I am not a perfect man,” Cohen said.  “I have done things I am not proud of, and I will live with the consequences of my actions for the rest of my life. ”10:30 a. m.  – Cohen paints damning picture of Trump in opening statementMichael Cohen tore into President Trump’s character and business acumen in a scathing opening statement, calling him \\\"a racist,\\\" \\\"a con man\\\" and \\\"a cheat. \\\"ABC News reported details of Cohen’s intended testimony earlier on Wednesday. Cohen divulged that Trump, as a candidate, knew Roger Stone was talking with Julian Assange about WikiLeaks' revealing of emails from the Democratic National Committee. 10:25 a. m.  – Cohen sworn in, gives opening statementMichael Cohen began his opening statement after rising, raising his right hand, and being sworn in. \\\"Chairman Cummings, Ranking Member Jordan, and Members of the Committee, thank you for inviting me here today,” Cohen said.  “I am here under oath to correct the record, to answer the Committee’s questions truthfully, and to offer the American people what I know about President Trump. ”10:18 a. m.  – Ranking Republican slams Cohen, Democrats in opening statementThe ranking Republican on the Oversight Committee launched an early attack on Michael Cohen’s credibility and Democrats’ willingness to hear the former fixer’s testimony on Wednesday. “The first announced witness for the 116th Congress is a guy who is going to prison in two months for lying to Congress,” Rep.  Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, said in his opening comments. Jordan criticized Cummings for offering “a convicted felon a forum to tell stories and lie about the president of the United States so they can all start their impeachment process. ”“They just want to use you, Mr.  Cohen,” Jordan said.  “You're their patsy today. ”10:12 a. m.  – Chairman Rep.  Cummings warns Cohen not to lieIn his opening statement, the committee’s chairman, Rep.  Elijah Cummings, warned Cohen against lying to his panel. “I have made it abundantly clear to Mr.  Cohen that if he comes here today and he does not tell us the truth, I will be the first one to refer those untruthful statements to DOJ (the Department of Justice),” Cummings said. Cohen pleaded guilty to lying to Congress in December – charges brought by special counsel Robert Mueller. Cummings added that its hearing today and moving forward reflect a new era of Democratic oversight. “The days of this committee protecting the president at all costs are over,” he said. 10:07 a. m.  – Republicans move to postpone Cohen’s hearingA top Republican leveled an early effort to stop Cohen’s testimony, demanding the hearing be delayed. Rep.  Mark Meadows, R-N. C. , raised a procedural tactic to delay the hearing, citing the short notice of the committee’s receipt of Cohen’s testimony and evidence he plans to present. The committee voted down Rep.  Meadows’ point of order and the hearing continued. 10 a. m.  Cohen takes witness chair, hearing beginsMichael Cohen entered the committee at 10 a. m on the dot and took the witness chair for what promised to be dramatic testimony about his former boss Donald Trump before the House Oversight Committee.  The panel's chairman, Rep.  Elijah Cummings, D-Md. , gaveled in the hearing shortly thereafter. The man who once said he would take a bullet for Donald Trump is poised to excoriate his longtime former boss with more than a decade of anecdotes. In his opening statement, Cohen is expected to characterize Trump as a “racist” and a “conman. ”9:55 a. m.  Committee members gathering inside hearing roomMembers of the House Oversight Committee are gathering in the committee’s hearing room with just minutes until Michael Cohen is expected to take his seat. Democrats met this morning in committee chambers before congregating in the hearing room.  Republicans on the panel have set up large posters with Cohen’s past comments flattering the president. Cohen had no comment as he arrived on Capitol Hill.  As he left his hotel Wednesday morning, staff and hotel guests greeted and wished him well, some hugging him and people saying “God bless you. ”“I’m going to do the right thing,” Cohen said.  He also called it “the craziest day” of his life. Cohen, who spent a decade at Trump's side at the Trump Organization, will testify before House lawmakers at 10 a. m.  Wednesday as President Trump wraps up his first day of meetings with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Vietnam. Cohen is scheduled to begin a three-year prison sentence in May and has pleaded guilty to lying to Congress as well as financial crimes including bank and tax fraud.  Cohen also pleaded guilty to campaign finance violation for payments made to adult film star Stormy Daniels during the 2016 presidential campaign. The White House, along with Republicans on Capitol Hill, sought to discredit Cohen ahead of his appearance. \\\"Disgraced felon Michael Cohen is going to prison for lying to Congress and making other false statements,\\\" White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said Tuesday in a statement.  \\\"Sadly, he will go before Congress this week and we can expect more of the same.  It's laughable that anyone would take a convicted liar like Cohen at his word, and pathetic to see him given yet another opportunity to spread his lies. \\\"Rep.  Matt Gaetz, R-Fla. , a staunch Trump ally, also tweeted Tuesday that the hearing could reveal alleged details about Cohen's romantic life, prompting outrage from Democrats and ethics experts. The stakes were also high for Democrats in the House, who have vowed to investigate the president and conduct oversight of the administration amid accusations of overreach from Republicans. House Oversight Committee Chairman Elijah Cummings, D-Md. , suggested the hearing \\\"may very well be a turning point in our country's history. \\\"\\\"He's the only person that I know of who has accused this president of a crime,\\\" he told reporters on Monday. Cohen was prepared to provide lawmakers with documents to support his claims that Trump allegedly inflated and deflated his net worth for personal and professional gain, and to avoid paying property taxes, according to a source familiar with his intended testimony. The president's former fixer was also expected to explain why he lied to Congress in 2017 about discussions he had during the presidential campaign about the proposed Trump Tower Moscow. His specific allegation of criminal wrongdoing relates to Trump's reimbursement to Cohen for the payment to adult film actress and director Stormy Daniels, who alleged an affair with Trump, according to the source familiar with Cohen's planned testimony. Trump has denied the affair alleged by Daniels and another accusation from former Playboy model Karen McDougal and has previously said the payment amounted to nothing more than a \\\"simple private transaction,\\\" and that they do not qualify as campaign finance violations. Cohen appeared before the House Oversight and Reform Committee after postponing an initial hearing date, citing \\\"threats\\\" to his family by Trump and his lawyer Rudy Giuliani. On Tuesday he spent hours behind closed doors with the Senate Intelligence Committee and will meet with the House Intelligence Committee in private on Thursday. \\\"Two years ago when this investigation started, I said it may be the most important thing I'm involved in my public life in the Senate,\\\" Sen.  Mark Warner, D-Va. , the top Democrat on the panel, told reporters after the panel questioned Cohen.  \\\"Nothing I have heard today dissuades me from that view. \\\"\\\"We will call out the Democrats' charade for what it is -- a partisan circus meant to destroy President Trump,\\\" Reps.  Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, and Mark Meadows, R-N. C. , said in a USA Today editorial. At Cohen's sentencing hearing in December, special counsel Robert Mueller's team said Cohen had cooperated with their investigation. Ahead of the House hearing, during his day with the Senate Intelligence Committee, Cohen was officially disbarred as a lawyer in New York, according to a decision from the Appellate Division of the New York State Supreme Court expected after his November guilty plea.

US stock markets continue to plummet over coronavirus uncertaintyThe Dow Jones Industrial Average plummeted more than 350 points during a volatile trading day on Friday, as financial markets continue to dive on uncertainty over the spread of the novel coronavirus. The Dow suffered its worst week since the financial crash of 2008. The Dow was down by 1. 37% at closing.  The S&P 500 and Nasdaq experienced similar volatility Friday, with steep drops during mid-morning trading.  The S&P 500 closed down just 0. 82% and the Nasdaq closed up by 0. 01%. Overall, the Dow has lost more than 3,500 points this week, or more than 12%. As markets plunged, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell issued a rare statement Friday, saying they was \\\"closely monitoring\\\" the situation and \\\"will use our tools and act as appropriate\\\" if needed. \\\"The fundamentals of the U. S.  economy remain strong.  However, the coronavirus poses evolving risks to economic activity,\\\" Powell said.  \\\"The Federal Reserve is closely monitoring developments and their implications for the economic outlook.  We will use our tools and act as appropriate to support the economy. \\\"Prior to Powell's statement, the Dow was briefly down by more than 900 points during intraday trading Friday. Experts and analysts emphasize it is the uncertainty about the outbreak and its full financial impact that is driving the market volatility. \\\"Ultimately, it is the uncertainty that is most difficult to price in, so people are selling in the advance of concrete information,\\\" Chris Zaccarelli, the chief investment officer for Independent Advisor Alliance said Friday. \\\"Based on what we know now, it remains our belief that the impact to the economy will be severe, but not enough to create a recession,\\\" he added. Mark Hamrick, the senior economic analyst at Bankrate, noted that for long-term investors, \\\"This jolt is a bump in the road that will eventually only be a memory. \\\"\\\"As with the outbreak, we cannot be confident of the depth or duration of the market’s decline or the economic impacts in the short-term,\\\" he added in a note Friday.  \\\"But also similar to the spread of the virus, we know that it will have a conclusion.  It will take some time to arrive at that point. \\\"Hamrick added that, \\\"long-term investors with the ability and fortitude to remain in the market should do just that. \\\"\\\"This is for certain: One locks in a loss by selling,\\\" he said. The plunge comes as the U. S.  Food and Drug Administration announced it's been alerted to the first manufacturing shortage of a drug due to a viral coronavirus outbreak that began in China and has now reached American soil. Officials also warned Americans earlier this week to prepare for community spread of coronavirus in the U. S. , and companies have warned investors of supply chain issues related to the outbreak. Among the worst performers Friday were the Boeing Company, J. P.  Morgan Chase and the Travelers Companies, which fell by 4. 4%, 4. 3% and 3. 4%, respectively. The best performers were Exxon Mobil, Microsoft and Dow Inc, which gained by 3. 25%, 2. 42% and 2. 17%, respectively. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events\",\"document_ocr\":\"25750\\n25500\\n25250\\n25000\\n10\\n11\\n12\\n2\\n3\\n-3.52%\\n-906.33\\nNYSE\\n▼ DJI\\n24,860.31\\n\",\"Category\":\"Insufficient_Text\"},{\"Id\":34939,\"claim_image\":\"http://pbs.twimg.com/media/DxxdgidW0AUdJ7n.jpg?format=jpg&name=large\",\"claim\":\"Americans increasingly blame Pres.

S.  government is over. President Trump tonight signed the continuing resolution that provides funding until Feb.  15.  The bill was signed in private tonight, without reporters present. Both the Senate and the House approved a measure to temporarily reopen the federal government.  The plan — which President Trump announced earlier today — will fund the government through Feb.  15. What happens now: The measure is heading to Trump's desk for his signature.  Once it is signed, it will put an end to the longest government shutdown in US history. You can follow the latest on the government shutdown here. From CNN's Liz StarkPresident Trump tonight is trying to push back on the way today’s agreement to reopen the government is being portrayed. He tweeted moments ago: From CNN's Phil MattinglyThe House of Representatives just passed a continuing resolution to fund the government until Feb.  15. The measure was passed by the Senate earlier today.  Now, it heads to President Trump's desk for his signature. From CNN's Liz Landers Over the past few days, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has been in “constant contact” with Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer as he had discussions with Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell on a path forward, according to a senior Democratic aide.  The two regularly consulted as those discussions proceeded. Throughout this shutdown, Pelosi made clear that the first step would be to reopen government and only then conduct negotiation.  This aide says it was “a position the President finally embraced today. ”This aide pointed to the 11 votes to reopen government since the Democrats took control on Jan.  3 as a key part of the strategy by Pelosi.  To do so many appropriations votes — starting with the individual Senate Republican bills — ultimately led to “unsustainable pressure on Senate Republicans. ”From CNN's Manu RajuSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell spoke with President Trump twice on Thursday — and Trump made the decision late Thursday that he wanted the shutdown to end, per a person familiar with their conversationsThe first call came after a contentious Senate GOP lunch where Republican senators vented frustration at Vice President Mike Pence about the lack of strategy to get out of the shutdown.  McConnell told Trump that it was unclear how much longer he could get GOP senators to hold the line — especially if there were another round of votes to end the shutdown. A few hours later, Trump called McConnell back with a new perspective: Trump made clear he wanted the shutdown to end, which led to the deal that was approved by Congress Friday. What's unclear, according to the source, is what exactly got Trump to change his mind in the intervening hours between their two phone calls. From CNN's Ashley Killough The House will vote at 6:30 p. m.  ET on the continuing resolution to end the government shutdown, a Democratic aide tells CNN. They'll also be voting on a Department of Homeland Security bill.  Both are expected to pass with unanimous consent.  After that, the resolution to fund the government will head to President Trump's desk for his signature. From CNN's Liz Landers  Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell flashed a quick smile at reporters as he walked off the floor to his office moments ago after the Senate passed a bill to reopen the government. When asked if anything good came out of this episode, Kentucky Sen.  Mitch McConnell said:Another reporter asked what finally ended the impasse — and specifically asked if it was the airport chaos we started to see materialize today. “You’d have to ask the President.  This was his proposal that we took up and passed. ”From CNN's Phil Mattingly and Liz LandersThe US Senate just passed the three-week continuing resolution to fund the government through Feb.  15.  The vote was by voice vote. The House still needs to pass the measure before President Trump can sign it.

Speaking at the launch of BJP’s first campaign for farmers in poll-bound West Bengal’s East Burdwan, which is considered the state’s rice bowl, Nadda cited the measures the government has taken over the last six years for the farm sector.  “Since the BJP came to power at the Centre [in 2014], Prime Minister Narendra Modi has made a six-fold increase in the central budget for farmers.  He implemented the minimum support price [at least 50% more than the weighted average cost of production] recommended by the Swaminathan Committee,” Nadda saidNadda insisted the three farm laws will make farmers free.  “These will enable farmers to set the price of their products and choose the buyer,” Nadda said. Nadda’s statement came a day after the eighth round of talks between the Centre and farmer unions failed to end the deadlock on Friday.  The Centre maintained it would not scrap the three laws and asked farmer unions to wait for the Supreme Court to weigh in on the issue.  The farm leaders stuck to the stand that the laws must be repealed and raised placards saying they will “prevail or die”. Sharp exchanges and tense arguments between the two sides were also reported even as they agreed to meet again on January 15. Thousands of protesting farmers have encircled Delhi for 45 days, demanding the government scrap the laws. The Supreme Court is set to take up a bunch of petitions challenging the validity of the laws on Monday.  The petitions have argued that the federal government does not have the powers to bring legislation on the agriculture sector because it falls in the domain of states.  The farm leaders have said even if the laws were declared constitutionally valid, they would continue to demand their repeal. Nadda, who also said that Bengal ranks 24th in the country when it comes to procurement price paid to farmers, announced the BJP will hold 40,000 meetings across Bengal before the assembly elections. Nadda also launched the door-to-door rice collection programme.  He visited five homes and collected the rice in a saffron bag slung on his left shoulder. Nadda, who offered prayers at the temple associated with the 15th-century saint Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, later had lunch at a farmer’s house. Nadda’s visit to Bengal comes as the Trinamool Congress (TMC) government is planning to hold a special session of the assembly to pass a resolution against the three farm laws. Nadda said the enthusiasm he has noticed shows that people of West Bengal have made up their mind to welcome the BJP.  He added chief minister Mamata Banerjee has now written to the Centre that she wants to implement the Prime Minister Kisan Samman Nidhi programme.  “We have been asking her for a long time to do it. ”Nadda accused the TMC leadership of corruption and misappropriating ration the Centre sent in view of the Covid-19 pandemic.  “Smuggling of coal and sand is all that you hear about these days.

Trump touts 'no collusion with Russia' after Mueller reportThe TAKE with Rick KleinNo collusion, no obstruction and no prosecution -- that's true to a point, and a significant point at that. But despite what President Donald Trump says, there is no exoneration.  There is certainly no conclusion to the issues that have consumed much of the Trump presidency, either. The questions probed by special counsel Robert Mueller and examined by the Department of Justice have now been kicked over to the political processes that were always going to have to deal with them anyway. Mueller was imbued with unrealistic expectations that he would render final judgments on an immensely complicated series of subjects.  He left it to the attorney general to determine whether the president obstructed justice, and Democrats on Capitol Hill will ask questions about that decision. Beyond that, and beyond the calls for the full Mueller report to be released, the Democratic presidential candidates are largely shrugging off the end of the Mueller era.  Most of them have long known he was never going to do the hard work for them. \\\"We need to recognize that's not going to change a lot of hearts and minds,\\\" Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, said over the weekend regarding the release of the Mueller report. The focus on Mueller will be in large measure about what he didn't find and what he opted not to do. But what he did bring to light -- in taking his time, in submitting his findings and in drawing out presidential actions along the way -- will be quite enough for the political system to digest for a long while. The RUNDOWN with John VerhovekWhile the key findings of Mueller's report have been made public, Democrats vying for the party's presidential nomination are still preaching transparency.  And as they prepare to campaign in the post-Mueller era, they are beginning to search for an effective messaging strategy that can no longer rely on the uncertainty surrounding the famed prosecutor's findings. \\\"It is not often that I agree with Richard Nixon, but he was right to say that the American people have a right to know whether or not their president is a crook. \\\" Sen.  Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N. Y. , said Sunday during her official campaign launch speech standing in front of the Trump International Hotel and Tower in New York City. \\\"Nobody, including the president of the United States, is above the law.  The people have a right to know what's in that report,\\\" Sen.  Bernie Sanders said over the weekend during a swing through California. But in a sign that they have known for some time that their hopes of beating Trump in 2020 could never depend on the contents of Mueller's report, most Democratic presidential hopefuls -- Gillibrand and Sanders included -- are instead focused on pitching policies and honing a message of an America that could move on from the partisan bickering and rancor that has defined the last two years. \\\"I am not running for president because of who I'm fighting against, I'm running for president because of who I'm fighting for,\\\" Gillibrand said Sunday. Sen.  Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass. , has been running a policy-centric campaign, while former Texas Congressman Beto O'Rourke is pitching himself as a unifying figure that could transcend the nastiness of today's political discourse. Whatever Mueller's full report does reveal, the tone of these Democratic contenders indicates that their strategy for victory in 2020 is not just to offer an anti-Trump argument, but to articulate a clear vision of the type of change they want to see in this country. The TIP with Samantha SergiDemocratic presidential candidates flocked to South Carolina in an attempt to court the black vote, but there were actually very few black voters at four events ABC News covered this weekend. Noticeably, O'Rourke and Buttigeig lacked diversity among the crowds they drew on Friday and Saturday in Columbia and Rock Hill, South Carolina.  Both cities are made up of roughly 47 percent of people of color. At a meet-and-greet event with O'Rourke on the University of South Carolina's campus in Columbia, five young, black women left 13 minutes into his speech when he was talking about the mass incarceration of black men. Compared to Sen.  Cory Booker, D-N. J. , and O'Rourke, Buttigeig drew the largest overall crowd during a Q&A session in the gymnasium of Clinton College, a historically black college in Rock Hill, South Carolina.  While the crowd was large, there were only a handful of people of color in attendance. THE PLAYLISTABC News' \\\"Start Here\\\" podcast.

This comes after the state’s premier administrative block witnessed a surge in coronavirus cases among its staff.  “On account of the increase in Covid-19 cases in the Secretariat, Departments/Offices it is directed that not more than 50% strength of the secretariat employees shall attend the office on a particular day and the remaining employees shall work from home on an alternate day basis,” an order issued by the joint secretary of general administration said.  The orders which come into effect from August 31 will remain in force at least until September 11, the order stated.  The comes over ten days after a staff of the secretariat protested against the government’s inaction in introducing social distancing measures for employees.  Back then, the number of cases was only around a dozen.  It has now crossed 50.  Also read: Unlock 4. 0 - What to expect from September 1On August 18, around 150 employees, alarmed by the rising Covid-19 cases in the administrative complex, had gathered in the foyer while a few called on the chief secretary to urge him to introduce either a 50 percent workforce or staggered a mode of working for the employees.  “If this continues like this then we will all become positive and the administration will totally collapse.  So before it collapses, the government should do something and send out some guidelines.  We cannot work from home because we don’t have amenities.  At least we can work at 50 percent strength, but there should be some clarity on how we are supposed to work,” Sukarna Pai, an employee of the revenue department, said.  Besides the secretariat, several other government departments have been plagued by Covid-19 with cases being detected in the electricity department, rural development agency, the Goa State AIDS Control Society and some district court complexes.  The Goa government also resisted making it optional for teachers to work and conduct online classes from home.  Instead, the government insisted that they report to school on all working days which led to some cases of infection among teachers. \",\"document_ocr\":\"\",\"Category\":\"Insufficient_Text\"},{\"Id\":34943,\"claim_image\":\"http://pbs.twimg.com/media/E0gykxMVkAA2Fob.png?format=jpg&name=large\",\"claim\":\"As MK Stalin sets out to take charge of Tamil Nadu, many challenges loom ahead\\n\\n(report by @bydivyac) \\n\\nhttps://t.co/IYBFExneBq https://t.co/T6kEXKG6fL\",\"claim_ocr\":\"\",\"document_image\":\"http://pbs.twimg.com/media/ExUxSAHVcAQjA3b.jpg?format=jpg&name=large\",\"document\":\"After a decade in opposition and the shadows of his father and five-time chief minister late M Karunanidhi, the big moment for Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) chief MK Stalin finally arrived on Sunday as the DMK-led alliance won 159 seats out of 294 in the Tamil Nadu assembly polls. While Stalin had led the party to a sweeping victory in the 2019 parliamentary elections, by winning 38 out of 39 seats, this year’s assembly election was a crucial test for his leadership as well as the future of his party. Click here for full coverage on electionsThe 68-year-old chief minister-elect for Tamil Nadu is ready to take on the new role at a time when the state is fighting the Covid-19 surge, debt and many more challenges. Here is taking a look at five challenges that the Stalin-led government would have to immediately deal with after assuming charge. Covid-19The current state government’s efforts to keep the pandemic under check was one of the major poll campaign highlights of outgoing chief minister Edappadi Palaniswami’s AIADMK and their ally BJP.  While they were knee jerk reactions, Palaniswami came on his own when the state, like others, was hit by the virus.  Tamil Nadu set a benchmark in conducting the highest number (2,29,56,942) of RT-PCR tests in the country and setting a low mortality rate of 1. 19% as compared to Maharashtra's 1. 49% and Delhi's 1. 42%.  An efficient health system that worked last year was introduced once again. Stalin will have to face a second wave that is more virulent.  Hospitals are filling fast and health workers are overworked.  The active caseload in the state is now twice as compared to last year and the same is thrice the number in Chennai, the state’s hotspot.  The new political appointees will have to ensure a smooth functioning with the bureaucratic arm of the state which has tackled the virus all this while.  There is also a massive vaccination program awaiting the state as it doesn’t have adequate supply to inoculate the population above 18 years of age. FinancesA huge financial burden is awaiting the new government.  In February, the AIADMK-led government presented a revenue deficit interim budget.  The state’s debt stood at ₹4. 87 lakh crore as of March 31, 2020, which was likely to go up to ₹5. 7 lakh crore amid the pandemic situation.  The state’s tax collection also remained low since 2016 amidst the overall economic decline, demonetisation and introduction of the Goods and Services Tax (GST).  The state has also complained of not receiving its due share as devolution from the central taxes and cesses and surcharges were not forming a part of the divisible pool of taxes. In its election manifesto, the DMK had said, “The incompetent AIADMK-led government has increased Tamil Nadu’s outstanding debt to about 9 lakh crores, thus resulting in every newborn carrying a debt of 1. 25 lakh rupees.  To make the necessary intervention and to advise the government on suitable action plans, a high-level expert committee shall be constituted. ”The DMK has promised a universal basic income of ₹1,000 for women heads of households, waive off education loans of students aged below 30 years, provide free tablets with data to school and college government students and a payout of ₹1,500 to 32 lakh widowed women, all single women above 50 years of age, differently-abled and Sri Lankan refugees. The new government will have to spend higher on healthcare, reboot the economy while also keeping several of its election promises, which may cause a huge burden on the exchequer. EmploymentProviding more job opportunities to youngsters and women has been an election promise of the DMK as the unorganised sector has been most hit by the pandemic and lockdown-like restrictions.  The party had also assured to pass legislation to reserve 75% of jobs for the locals.  It set a goal of providing 10 lakh jobs each year and 50 lakh jobs to youngsters by the end of 2025-26.  It promised to bring in more industries and increase the number of working days under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) from 100 to 150 days. EducationThe Covid-19 pandemic has pushed schools and colleges to conduct online classes and reduce the curriculum, affecting students’ learning.  According to the Annual Status of Education Report released in October 2020, at least a quarter of students in Tamil Nadu was not involved in any learning activity during the entire week of the survey period. The state government had earned the criticism of educationists as well as the Madras high court over its order to cancel arrear exams in arts and science colleges and declare students as “all-pass”.  The new government will require an expert committee to help address the setback for students in the past year and discuss the way forward. Administration/ PoliticsThe state’s relationship with the Centre will play a critical role for the new government keeping in mind that Stalin has remained on a head-on collision with the AIADMK-BJP combine.  While the DMK chief has promised to retrieve the state’s rights and autonomy, it remains to be seen how he intends to negotiate via requests and tackle troubles with the BJP-led Centre. \",\"document_ocr\":\"MANI\\n\",\"Category\":\"Insufficient_Text\"},{\"Id\":34944,\"claim_image\":\"http://pbs.twimg.com/media/D2dwqseU0AAcOj_.jpg?format=jpg&name=large\",\"claim\":\"Democrats want Attorney General Barr to testify before Congress on Mueller report: \\\"The American people are entitled to a full accounting of the president's misconduct referenced by the special counsel.\\\" https://t.co/U5T5Tx8cgl https://t.co/9r12VG9oWA\",\"claim_ocr\":\"abc\\nNEWS\\nHOUSE OF\\nU.S.\\nThe president has not been exonerated\\nFOX\\n5 AP\\nby the special counsel,\\nREPRS\\n\",\"document_image\":\"http://pbs.twimg.com/media/D2geJXVWsAMQHf1.jpg?format=jpg&name=large\",\"document\":\"\\n  Former White House aide Cliff Sims suggested Monday President Donald Trump may use the findings of special counsel Robert Mueller’s report as a “political bludgeon” against Democratic presidential candidates.  \\n\\n  On Sunday, Attorney General William Barr said in a letter to Congress that Mueller’s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election did not find that the Trump campaign conspired with Russia.

Chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal instructed the authorities of the affected districts to reach out to the flood-hit people on a war footing and adhere to the Covid-19 safety protocols during the relief-and-rescue operations. The deluge claimed one more life in the worst-hit Dhemaji district, where over 91,000 people are affected, according to the daily flood bulletin of the Assam State Disaster Management Authority (ASDMA). The number of flood-hit people in Dhemaji, Jorhat, Majuli, Sivasagar and Dibrugarh districts was 38,000 on Wednesday, while the swirling floodwaters entered Lakhimpur, Biswanath, Golaghat and Tinsukia districts, raising the figure to 1. 89 lakh on Thursday. Tinsukia and Dibrugarh districts were also badly affected, accounting for 24,239 and 18,500 flood-hit people respectively, the ASDMA said. The flood has submerged 19,430 hectares of farm land with standing crops. The authorities are running 49 relief camps and distribution centres in five districts, where 11,468 people have taken shelter. The Brahmaputra river is flowing above the danger mark at Neamatighat in Jorhat district, Dhubri town in Dhubri district and Tezpur in Sonitpur district, the bulletin said. Besides damaging roads and other infrastructure, the floodwaters have caused massive erosion at various places. Meanwhile, the chief minister took stock of the flood situation and asked the deputy commissioners to provide essential relief materials to the affected people, according to official sources. He asked the Tinsukia DC to ensure that the fire tenders moving to and from Baghjan, where a gas well has been blazing for the last 30 days, do not face any bottleneck. A bridge on the way to Baghjan was damaged in the flood and a Bailey bridge should be built there for unhindered movement of the vehicles engaged in emergency services, the chief minister said. Sonowal also asked the state-owned power utility, Assam Power Distribution Company Limited, to take steps to avert accidents due to electrocution. In view of the coronavirus outbreak, he directed the DCs to ensure that the district machinery assiduously adheres to the Covid-19 safety protocols.  \",\"document_ocr\":\"\",\"Category\":\"Insufficient_Text\"},{\"Id\":34946,\"claim_image\":\"http://pbs.twimg.com/media/EsV8SlDXYAEp_cv.jpg?format=jpg&name=large\",\"claim\":\"From J-K to Kerala, bird flu spreads to 13 Indian states, union territories\\n\\nhttps://t.co/QjAxdgnZFD https://t.co/dstagiopLR\",\"claim_ocr\":\"\",\"document_image\":\"http://pbs.twimg.com/media/ErcRn58UUAAymSn.jpg?format=jpg&name=large\",\"document\":\"Signalling a second wave, 13 Indian states have reported bird flu outbreaks till Friday affecting poultry birds, crows, migratory birds and wild birds.

The animal husbandry ministry had also asked states for timely collection and submission of samples for confirmation and further surveillance and intensification of surveillance plan. To prevent the disease transmission from affected birds to poultry and humans, the ministry has asked states to follow the general prevention guidelines. “Coordination with the forest department for reporting any unusual mortality of birds was also suggested to the States.  The other states were also requested to keep a vigil on any unusual mortality amongst birds and to report immediately to take necessary measures,” the ministry said in a statement. Bird flu, also known as Avian Flu, is a variety of influenza caused by a virus in birds.  It can spread to humans and can trigger person to person transmission, experts say.  There are many varieties of viruses and H7N9 is considered most dangerous among them, they say.  According to the World Health Organization there are many subtypes of avian influenza virus and only some of them will be dangerous to humans.  Migratory birds are reported to be the main carriers of the virus. The Union ministry of fisheries, animal husbandry and dairying has previously pointed to migratory birds as a cause for the spread of flu which has triggered an alarm in north, central and southern India.  “In India, the disease spreads mainly by migratory birds coming into India during winter months i. e.  from September-October to February-March.  The secondary spread by human handling (through fomites) cannot be ruled out,” the ministry had said. \",\"document_ocr\":\"GOVERNMENT OF KERALA\\n\",\"Category\":\"Insufficient_Text\"},{\"Id\":34947,\"claim_image\":\"http://pbs.twimg.com/media/DyCAgJ2X0AAiD_f.jpg?format=jpg&name=large\",\"claim\":\"The price of a \\\"Forever\\\" stamp just went up a nickel -- to 55 cents.

The Midwest may see its coldest air since the mid-1990s early Wednesday. In Minnesota, wind chills could be as low as minus 35 degrees Monday night and as low as minus 65 degrees Tuesday into Thursday morning, the National Weather Service warned. All Minneapolis public schools were closed Monday and the city has declared a snow emergency due to the heavy snow pounding the area. There were over 100 car crashes in Minnesota Monday morning, the state patrol said. The storm moved east throughout the day, from Minnesota to Wisconsin, where a state of emergency was declared. The snow then moved on to a chilly Chicago. Over 1,000 flights were canceled at Chicago's airports Monday as the snow hit. The weather dangers had hit the Midwest even before the snowstorm.  This weekend, Chicago police officers rescued a man and his dog from a frozen Lake Michigan. The same storm will head south and is set to bring slippery roads to Atlanta and Birmingham Tuesday morning. Overnight Monday into Tuesday rain will change to an icy mix and snow even as far south as Mississippi and Louisiana when temperatures dip below freezing. City government offices in Atlanta will be closed Tuesday, the mayor said. By Tuesday night the storm will move across the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic with rain changing to snow from North Carolina to Maine. Six to 12 inches of snow could hit parts of the interior Northeast before the storm leaves Wednesday morning. New York City, Washington and Boston will likely just see rain. Following that winter storm, extremely dangerous cold weather is headed to the Midwest and Northeast. Several daily record lows are expected to be broken in the Midwest on Wednesday morning, where temperatures may be the lowest in over 20 years.

Seated at a round table with US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, Trump asked photographers to make him and Kim \\\"look good\\\" in their photos. \\\"We’re going to have a very busy day tomorrow,\\\" Trump said, adding later: \\\"Our relationship is a very special relationship. \\\"Watch the moment here:From CNN’s Sol Han in Hong KongNorth Korean leader Kim Jong Un said his second sit-down with Donald Trump is thanks to a \\\"courageous political decision\\\" by the US President. Addressing reporters beside Trump on Wednesday in Hanoi, Kim said that there had been \\\"a lot of thinking, effort and patience\\\" between now and last June, when he met the US leader in Singapore. Kim said the \\\"outside world\\\" has \\\"misunderstood\\\" the US-North Korean relationship in the period after the Singapore summit.  He said he is hoping the Hanoi summit delivers \\\"an outcome welcome by everyone. \\\"Kim said the pair shared a \\\"very interesting conversation\\\" for 30 minutes upon meeting Wednesday.  From CNN's Samantha BeechPresident Trump promised North Korea a \\\"tremendous future for your country\\\" in his first talks with leader Kim Jong Un in Hanoi.  \\\"I think your country has tremendous economic potential,\\\" Trump said. \\\"I think you will have a tremendous future for your country, you’re a great leader,\\\" Trump told Kim.  \\\"We will help it to happen. \\\"Watch the moment here:From CNN's James GriffithsPresident Trump and North Korean leader Kim have met for the second time.  The two leaders clasped hands and posed in front of flags smiling as members of the international press took photos.  Trump said he looked forward to a \\\"very successful\\\" summit.  Kim said \\\"we have been able to overcome all the obstacles and here we are today. \\\"In response, Trump said \\\"it's an honor to be with Chairman Kim, it's an honor to be together in Vietnam. \\\"\\\"It's great to be with you, we had a very successful first summit,\\\" he added.  \\\"Some people wanted to see it go quicker, but I was very happy with how we are doing. \\\" Trump said the two leaders' relationship is \\\"really a good one. \\\" Neither man responded to shouted questions from the press, most of which were targeted at Trump, one reporter audibly asking about recent revelations by the President's former lawyer, Michael Cohen.  Watch the greeting: From CNN's James GriffithsPresident Trump has arrived at the Metropole Hotel, where he will shortly be meeting North Korean leader Kim.  Onlookers lined the motorcade route from the hotel where Trump is staying while in Hanoi, waving and holding up their phones.  The route took the US President past the North Korean embassy. Kim's motorcade is also en route to the hotel.  From CNN's Joshua Berlinger in HanoiAccording to a schedule released by the White House, President Trump and North Korean leader Kim will be arriving at the Metropole Hotel shortly, where they will be meet in person for the second time ahead of a private dinner tonight.  Nearby the hotel, which has been largely cordoned off to the public amid heavy security, the famous Lotus Water Puppet Theater has erected portraits of the two leaders, one showing Trump waving in front of the US and Vietnamese flags.  From CNN's Joshua Berlinger in HanoiNorth Korean leader Kim Jong Un is due to meet President Trump on Wednesday evening to begin their second summit. The outcome is highly unpredictable but experts said there are many ways Kim could declare the summit a victory. \\\"Kim Jong Un has several paths to a win in Hanoi -- and unfortunately Trump seems determined to make it happen,\\\" said Adam Mount, Senior Fellow and Director, Defense Posture Project, Federation of American Scientists. \\\"Kim gains a modest win by just showing up and repeating his performance at Singapore -- being seen to engage the United States as a nuclear power, gaining new opportunities for diplomacy and trade and raising the chance of sanctions relief from Beijing and Seoul. \\\"From CNN's James GriffithsA lot of what President Trump and North Korean leader Kim discuss at their second summit in Hanoi will be kept private, but can we learn anything from their body language?  Translation and interpretation expert Julie Giguere thinks so, she says their behavior at the previous meeting in Singapore showed evidence of their different cultural backgrounds and gave insight into their feelings.  \\\"When moving from initial meeting to the summit setting, Trump invited Kim to walk ahead of him.  This could be interpreted as a desire to calm the situation and the President also used his hand to guide the younger man, which can be seen as an indication of a desire to assert dominance,\\\" Giguere said in an email. \\\"While the two leaders spoke last time, Kim spent most of the time looking down and listening while Trump spoke in a largely conciliatory manner.  Trump’s more aggressive body language and Kim patting Trump on the shoulder, both of which were interpreted as a desire to assert control, belied the apparent passivity on both sides. ” She added it was important for observers to take into account differences in American and North Korean etiquette.  \\\"The bow plays an important role in Korean greetings and etiquette in general.  This is one of the ways in which Trump could show a small amount of recognizable politeness and respect to the North Korean leader without being too friendly, especially given they have met before,\\\" Giguere said.  \\\"Giving a straight 'no' is simply not done in North Korean business etiquette.  You might suggest a 'maybe,' but you would never just say 'no. ' It's an easy way to be very rude and this is something on which the President should certainly have been advised. \\\"From CNN's James GriffithsPresident Trump has tweeted again from Hanoi, where he is due to be meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in a couple hours, saying the pair will \\\"try very hard to work something out\\\" with regard to denuclearization.

FBI arrests longtime Trump adviser Roger StonePresident Donald Trump's longtime friend and veteran political operative Roger Stone was arrested Friday morning after special counsel Robert Mueller filed a seven-count indictment against him as part of an ongoing probe into Russia interference during the 2016 presidential election. The special counsel leveled against Stone, 66, five counts of lying to Congress, one count of obstruction of an official proceeding, and one count of witness tampering. Stone was arrested and appeared in court in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, late Friday morning.  The indictment was filed on Thursday. Within hours of the FBI’s pre-dawn arrest at his home in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, Stone made an initial court appearance Friday morning, where a federal judge set his bond at $250,000 and limited his travel to Florida, New York, Virginia and Washington, DC, where he will be arraigned next week. The charges brought by Mueller’s office largely revolve around false statements Stone is accused of making to the House and Senate Intelligence Committees regarding his communications with associates about Wikileaks. In court documents unsealed Friday morning, Mueller’s prosecutors wrote that after WikiLeaks began releasing internal Democratic National Committee emails in the summer of 2016, an unidentified \\\"senior Trump campaign official was directed to contact Stone about any additional releases and what other damaging information [Wikileaks] had regarding the Clinton Campaign. \\\"\\\"Stone thereafter told the Trump Campaign about potential future releases of damaging material by [Wikileaks],\\\" prosecutors say. In a hastily organized press conference following his court appearance, a defiant Stone pledged to fight the charges. “I am falsely accused of making false statements,” he said, shouting over protesters outside the courthouse.  “There is no circumstance whatsoever under which I will bear false witness against the president. . .  I look forward to being fully and completely vindicated. ”Stone, 66, struggled to shout over protesters chanting “lock him up! ” – a reference to chants of “lock her up” directed at Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton at Trump rallies during the 2016 campaign. Although never mentioned by name, WikiLeaks' alleged role in the 2016 presidential campaign was previously referenced in Mueller’s indictment of 12 Russian intelligence officers, whom the special counsel’s office accused of hacking Democrats' emails. During the campaign, WikiLeaks published emails allegedly hacked and stolen from Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign chairman John Podesta and documents from the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and Democratic National Committee.  Some of the hacked emails were first published on the \\\"DCLeaks\\\" website, which Mueller alleges was a front for Russian military intelligence, known as the GRU. In addition to the pre-dawn raid on his Florida home, federal agents obtained a search warrant for Stone’s New York home – described as a “spacious two bedroom” apartment in Harlem.  Agents were spotted Friday taking hard drives and other evidence from the apartment. An attorney for Stone, Grant Smith, chalked up Stone’s alleged lies to Congress as “something he honestly forgot about” and “vowed to fight the charges. ”President Donald Trump weighed in with a tweet, calling Mueller’s investigation the “Greatest Witch Hunt in the History of our Country! ” One of Trump’s lawyers, Jay Sekulow, released a statement arguing that “the indictment today does not allege Russian collusion by Roger Stone or anyone else,” adding, “rather, the indictment focuses on alleged false statements made to Congress. ”Stone, who has taken credit for persuading Trump to get into politics, served as an adviser to Trump’s presidential campaign but left amid controversy in 2015. Rep.  Eric Swalwell, a Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, to which Stone is accused of making false statement, told ABC News Friday he believes the indictment is important because “it shows the Trump Organization was aware of his efforts.  It shows there was awareness of Stone’s efforts to get the hacked emails. ”“It also puts into context why Donald Trump was talking so much about WikiLeaks,” Swalwell said.  “Why was Trump talking so often about new information that was coming?  Why was he talking so much about WikiLeaks?  Why did he make that invitation to the Russians?  Now you know they had a connection in Roger Stone. ”House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Friday night issued a statement saying it is \\\"staggering that the President has chosen to surround himself with people who violated the integrity of our democracy and lied to the FBI and Congress about it. \\\"\\\"The indictment of Roger Stone makes clear that there was a deliberate, coordinated attempt by top Trump campaign officials to influence the 2016 election and subvert the will of the American people,\\\" Pelosi said in the statement. The youngest person to testify in the Senate Watergate hearings at the age of 20, Stone – who is known for - among other things - a tattoo of Nixon's face on his back– was profiled in a 2016 Netflix documentary, \\\"Get Me Roger Stone,\\\" which focused on his eccentric political career and painted him as the original architect of Trump’s political career. The special counsel’s indictment comes amid scrutiny about the self-described “dirty trickster” and his alleged contact with WikiLeaks publisher Julian Assange in the summer of 2016.  Stone has told ABC News multiple times that he had never met or spoken with Assange and had no intermediary providing a back channel to communicate with the controversial WikiLeaks founder. Mueller's interest in Stone and WikiLeaks goes to the heart of the U. S.  intelligence community’s conclusion, released in a report in January 2017, that the online organization weaponized and published damaging information provided to it by a hacker from the Russian government on Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and her campaign. In July, the mercurial Stone told ABC News that he is the unnamed Trump campaign regular who allegedly corresponded with Russian hackers, as described in special counsel Mueller’s July 13 indictment against a dozen Russians intelligence officers, who were posing as a hacker, Guccifer 2. 0.  The indictment alleges that the 12 Russians engaged in a sustained effort to hack Democrats and aides to Clinton during the 2016 presidential campaign.  Stone has dismissed his short Twitter direct message communications with Guccifer 2. 0 as innocuous and denied knowledge that Russian agents were behind the account. More than a dozen witnesses associated with Stone have been contacted by the special counsel's office, many of whom have appeared before the grand jury impaneled by Mueller’s team.  The witnesses have told ABC News they were asked about Stone’s dealings during the 2016 election and what, if any, contact he may have had with Assange through an intermediary. Among them is political humorist and radio show host Randy Credico, whom Stone claims to have asked to act as an intermediary for him to contact Assange to confirm that the Wikileaks founder had a cache of information on Clinton during the 2016 campaign. The list also includes Jerome Corsi, the former Washington bureau chief of the far right site, Infowars, who is known for his role in pushing political smear campaigns. Over the course of his nearly two-year-long probe, Mueller and his team of prosecutors have now indicted 34 individuals and three Russian businesses on charges ranging from computer hacking to conspiracy and financial crimes. Those indictments have led to seven guilty pleas and three people sentenced to prison.  Four former Trump campaign officials -- including his onetime national security adviser Michael Flynn and campaign chairman Paul Manafort, also a former associate of Stone – are among those who have pleaded guilty. In October, ABC News reported that special counsel prosecutors had been asking Manafort — their newest cooperating witness — about Stone, who was Manafort’s friend and had also been his partner at the lobbying firm Black, Manafort, Stone and Kelly in the 1980s, according to multiple sources familiar with the matter. Stone told ABC News in November, “There’s no circumstance under which I bear false witness against President Trump. ”ABC News' Aaron Katersky, Janice McDonald, Scott Withers and Tom Llamas contributed to this report.  24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events\",\"document_ocr\":\"abc\\n\\\"When I read this\\nNEWS\\nindictment this\\nmorning, it once\\nagain proved out\\njust how smart\\nand careful Robert\\nMueller is being...\\nThis has got to be\\na very disturbing\\nday for some\\nsenior members\\nof the Trump\\ncampaign.\\\"\\nCHRIS CHRISTIE\\n\",\"Category\":\"Insufficient_Text\"},{\"Id\":34950,\"claim_image\":\"http://pbs.twimg.com/media/EzpCd5fVgAA8O0L.jpg?format=jpg&name=large\",\"claim\":\"Provide vaccine to the states at the same rate as the Central govt.

Soren said, “The government is working day and night to help people during this period of drastic transition.  I believe we can beat coronavirus with cooperation from all. ”Earlier, the state government urged the central government to reduce the previous age limit of 45 for vaccine beneficiaries in light of the rapidly spreading infection among younger people. The Union government recently on Monday announced that all persons above 18 years of age will be eligible for Covid-19 shots from May 1.  The registration for the same will begin from April 28.

As per a bulletin of the state health department, more than 25. 15 lakh people were administered the first dose of the vaccine till Thursday, while over 3. 93 lakh people received their second dose. However, a decline in footfall of first dose seekers was witnessed on Thursday, that some health experts blamed on the confusion arising due to the ongoing week-long lockdown in the state that began April 22.  However, no major change was witnessed in the case of second dose beneficiaries. Even though state nodal officer (vaccination) Dr Ajit Prasad expressed his inability to comment on the matter, as he was also suffering from Covid-19 infection, officials at a vaccination office said the drop in footfall of first dose seekers was witnessed, while it partially increased in case of second dose. “There are many reasons behind the slight fall in case of first dose.  There may be confusion over lockdown, while some may be scared of visiting vaccination centres due to the sudden case surge.  However, we are working to address the issue and we hope it will increase soon,” a senior official said, requesting anonymity.

From CNN's Jason HoffmanCedric Richmond, senior adviser to President Biden, said there is no new timetable from the White House on police reform legislation, but said he is optimistic over the state of the negotiations. Richmond said the administration is “doing everything we can” to get legislation passed including offering any advice or technical assistance asked of it. Richmond said there is not a new timeline from the White House on passing police reform, after the original deadline of today came and went without a bill, and that the President wants something that is right, not rushed.  “It’s more important to have meaningful legislation than to meet a deadline or a timeline and I think that that came out today in the conversation with the family, that the President wanted something that is right, not necessarily rushed,” he said.  Richmond would not discuss the negotiations over qualified immunity during the interview, saying those negotiations have been going on behind the scenes and that’s where they should stay.  From CNN's Jason Hoffman and Phil MattinglyVice President Kamala Harris spoke about her meeting with the family of George Floyd at the White House on Tuesday, saying “they have shown such dignity in the face of such an atrocious tragedy. ”“In their grief, they are so generous in the way that they have been supporting other families and supporting a system that should rightly yield in the face of injustice to what we know needs to be reformed,” she added. The vice president said she is in awe of their continuing courage, their selflessness and the way they have approached this. Harris also echoed her written statement after the meeting with Floyd’s family, saying “George Floyd should be alive today. ”She said the administration is watching and waiting to see what comes from the negotiations on police reform on Capitol Hill. “The work that they have been doing has been I think intensive work throughout the weekends,” Harris said.  “So they’re working around the clock from everything I can see and we’re waiting to hear but there seems to be a sense of optimism coming from the Hill and that gives me a sense of optimism and we’ll wait and see. \\\"From CNN's Jessica DeanBenjamin Crump, the attorney of George Floyd's family, said GOP Sen.  Tim Scott told him any policing overhaul bill will be named the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act.  Crump and the Floyd family spoke with reporters following their meeting with Democratic Sen.  Cory Booker.  When asked earlier by reporters if they’re optimistic about a police reform deal getting done, Crump gave them a thumbs up. From CNN’s Omar Jimenez and Keith AllenDarnella Frazier, the teenager who was on her way to a Minneapolis store to buy snacks with her young cousin last May 25 when she recorded the clearest video of former police officer Derek Chauvin pressing his knee into George Floyd’s neck for over nine minutes, released a statement on Tuesday to mark the one-year anniversary of Floyd’s death. “A year ago, today I witnessed a murder.  The victim’s name was George Floyd.  Although this wasn’t the first time, I’ve seen a Black man get killed at the hands of the police, this is the first time I witnessed it happen in front of me.  Right in front of my eyes, a few feet away,” Frazier said in a statement to CNN. Frazier’s video of Floyd’s final moments was widely credited for helping secure a guilty verdict against Chauvin, and Minnesota Gov.  Tim Walz publicly thanked her after the trial. \\\"Taking that video, I think many folks know, is maybe the only reason that Derek Chauvin will go to prison,\\\" Walz said last month. “A lot of people call me a hero even though I don’t see myself as one.  I was just in the right place at the right time,” Frazier said Tuesday. “Behind this smile, behind these awards, behind the publicity, I’m a girl trying to heal from something I am reminded of every day.  Everyone talks about the girl who recorded George Floyd‘s death, but to actually be her is a different story,” Frazier added. Frazier, now 18, said her life was forever changed by that moment, and she spoke about the challenges she and her family have faced in the year since she witnessed Floyd’s death, adding that she’s suffered from sleeplessness, anxiety and panic attacks in the aftermath. “I used to shake so bad at night my mom had to rock me to sleep.  Hopping from hotel to hotel because we didn’t have a home and looking over our back every day in the process,” the statement read. From CNN's Elise HammondAs the sports world came together to pay their respects to George Floyd after his death in Minnesota a year ago, many organizations are also speaking out on the anniversary of his killing on Tuesday. Floyd's death sparked nationwide protests, with many prominent athletes and teams participating in advocacy and demonstrations. The Women's National Basketball Players Association released a statement on the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act – a bill that would do things like set up a national registry of police misconduct, ban chokeholds and no-knock warrants and make it easier to prosecute officers for wrongdoing, among other things. The WNBPA said in a statement it remains hopeful and that the measure is an \\\"important first step for comprehensive policing reform. \\\"\\\"Excessive force used against communities of color is past crisis-level.  Excessive force used against communities of color demands action by Congress,\\\" the statement said. The National Basketball Players Association tweeted, \\\"How many more need to be killed before Congress takes action? \\\" It urged people to call their senators and tell them to support the bill. The NBA said a year ago Floyd's death inspired a social justice movement and called on people to rally against systemic racism, it said in a tweet. \\\"Today and every day, members of the NBA family stand united in working for change and a future that provides true equality,\\\" the NBA said. Several high-profile NBA athletes were vocal about the killing of Floyd. Professional teams in Minnesota – including the Vikings, the Timberwolves, the Lynx, the Wild and Minnesota United – all tweeted messages in Floyd's memory.  Several of them were photos of memorials or murals around the city. The Players Alliance, the Major League Baseball players group, tweeted a statement pledging to create a more \\\"inclusive, equitable future – both in our game and in our world. \\\"The NFL said it has been a year filled with \\\"reflection and reckoning, one that has renewed our commitment to build and strengthen our communities. \\\"It also tweeted a video which featured players talking about how Floyd's murder affected them.

Tim Scott and Lindsey Graham, Benjamin Crump, the attorney of George Floyd's family, said “we’re optimistic” that Congress is “close, the closest they’ve ever been” to reaching a bipartisan agreement on a policing reform bill. Scott told CNN on Tuesday after the meeting that he felt the Floyd family was very receptive to all the parts of the bill they discussed. “I was pleasantly surprised and encouraged by their thoughts,” Scott said, adding, “I wish I was negotiating with them. \\\"One year ago today, George Floyd was killed by a police officer in Minneapolis.

Harris said that the video of Floyd’s death one year ago “revealed to the country what Black Americans have known to be true for generations. ”“The verdict finding Derek Chauvin guilty of murder provided some measure of justice.

Trump wraps US-North Korea summit with press conferenceHanoi, Vietnam -- President Donald Trump and North Korea's Kim Jong Un concluded their second summit in Vietnam in an apparent stalemate, with Trump announcing U. S.  negotiators walked away over North Korea's insistence that it relax some sanctions before full dismantlement of the country's nuclear program. Trump and Kim met at the historic Metropole Hotel in downtown Hanoi, which is 12 hours ahead of Eastern Standard Time, after a brief one-on-one meeting Wednesday and an hour and a half-long dinner with their top aides, including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney. Trump touted the two days of meetings as \\\"productive\\\" and downplayed any deterioration in his personal rapport with the young leader, who he said committed to not carry out any further nuclear or missile tests as negotiations continued. \\\"You always have to be prepared to walk,\\\" Trump said at a press conference.  \\\"I could have 100 percent signed something today.  We actually had papers ready to be signed, but it was not appropriate.  I would rather do it right.  I would rather do it right than fast. \\\"As he prepares to return to major political headwinds back in Washington, Trump dismissed the bombshell testimony of his former personal lawyer Michael Cohen as 'fake' and attacked Democrats for holding the hearing while he was seeking a nuclear agreement. Here's how the day unfolded:3:51 a. m.  (EST) - Trump departs Hanoi, VietnamThe president has departed Hanoi, Vietnam.  He is headed back to the United States, following his second summit with North Korea's leader. \\\"I am about to get on a plane and fly back to a wonderful place called Washington, D. C. , \\\" Trump said, with a hint of sarcasm, at the end of his roughly 40-minute-long press conference. The president was originally scheduled to depart two hours later, but the cancellation of a signing ceremony with Kim moved up the travel schedule. Based on the shift in his schedule, Trump was expected to arrive in Washington late Thursday evening, following a refueling stop at a yet-to-be disclosed location. 2:55 a. m.  (EST) - Trump says he has confronted Kim about Otto Warmbier's death, but believes Kim's denials of responsibilityTrump told reporters in Vietnam that in his meetings with Kim he confronted the leader about Otto Warmbier.  The 21-year-old American student was arrested and imprisoned in North Korea for more than a year.  He died after returning to the U. S.  in a state of unresponsive wakefulness, according to his family. However, the president signaled that he believed Kim didn't share any personal responsibility in Warmbier's death. \\\"I really believe something very bad happened to him and I don't think that the top leadership knew about it,\\\" Trump said.  \\\"I did speak about it and I don't believe that [Kim] would have allowed that to happen.  Just wasn't to his advantage to allow that to happen. \\\"Trump added that Kim \\\"felt badly\\\" about Warmbier's death and described North Korea's prison system -- condemned around the world, by multiple human rights groups, as \\\"rough places. \\\"\\\"You got a lot of people, it's a big country, a lot of people,\\\" Trump said.  \\\"And in those prisons and those camps you have a lot of people and some really bad things happened to Otto, some really, really bad things.  But he tells me he didn't know about it and I will take him at his word. \\\"The White House has said in the past that the talks between Kim and Trump were focused almost solely on denuclearization, rather than the issue of North Korea's human rights record. The moment is likely to stir significant controversy, similar to Trump's statement in Helsinki last year accepting Russian President Vladimir Putin's denials of interference in the 2016 U. S.  election, as well as his acceptance of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's rejection of responsibility for journalist Jamal Khashoggi's murder. 2:49 a. m.  (EST) - Trump downplays breakdown in talks, says Kim told him nuclear testing 'will not start' up againDuring his press conference, the president dismissed the idea that the breakdown of his talks with Kim meant their relationship has soured.  He said Kim has committed to him that nuclear and missile tests will not restart, despite no agreement being reached. \\\"He said the testing will not start,\\\" Trump said.  \\\"He said he is not going to do testing of rockets or missiles or anything having to do with nuclear. \\\"Trump again heaped praise on the young leader, continuing the trend of emphasizing his personal relationship with Kim even amid the stalled talks. \\\"We just like each other,\\\" Trump said.  \\\"We have a good relationship.  It's a totally different system to put it mildly but we like each other. \\\"Trump said a sticking point in the negotiations came over the U. S.  demands that North Korea dismantle its Yongbyon nuclear enrichment facility, which Kim wouldn't agree to unless sanctions were relaxed on the country. \\\"We had to have more than that,\\\" Trump said.  \\\"We brought many points up that I think they were surprised we knew, but we had to do more than just the one level, because if we did the one level and gave up all that leverage that has taken a long time to build. \\\"2:24 a. m.  (EST) – Trump slams ‘fake’ Cohen hearing: ‘He lied about a lot’Trump offered his first reaction to the congressional testimony by his former personal lawyer Michael Cohen during a press conference in Hanoi, labeling Cohen as a \\\"liar\\\" and hitting Democrats for holding the hearing during his summit with Kim. \\\"I think having a fake hearing like that and having it in the middle of this very important summit is really a terrible thing,\\\" Trump said. When asked by ABC News’ Chief White House correspondent Jonathan Karl about the allegations leveled by Cohen against him, Trump said Cohen was \\\"incorrect\\\" to call him a \\\"liar,\\\" \\\"a con-man\\\" and a \\\"racist. \\\"\\\"He lied a lot,\\\" Trump said.  \\\"But it was very interesting because he didn't lie about one thing, he said, 'no collusion with the Russian hoax. ' I said, 'I wonder why he didn't lie about that too like everything else? '\\\"\\\"I was a little impressed by that, frankly,\\\" Trump said. 2:18 a. m.  (EST) – Trump explains North Korea summit ending without an agreement: ‘Sometimes you have to walk’At a press conference prior to his departure from Hanoi, Trump explained why his second summit with Kim resulted in no signed agreement between the two countries as previously planned. \\\"We thought, and I thought, and Secretary Pompeo felt that it wasn't a good thing to be signing anything,\\\" Trump said.  \\\"Sometimes you have to walk.  This was just one of those times. \\\"Pompeo went on to explain that Kim was \\\"unprepared\\\" to go as far in the agreement as the U. S.  had wanted, but that negotiating teams would continue to convene in the \\\"days and weeks ahead\\\" to resolve their differences. Trump acknowledged the break down was due to North Korea’s demands that sanctions be lifted in exchange for steps towards denuclearization, which would amount to a departure from longstanding U. S.  policy that no sanctions be lifted before North Korea completely dismantles its nuclear program. \\\"It was about the sanctions,\\\" Trump said.  \\\"Basically they wanted the sanctions lifted in their entirety and we couldn't do that. \\\"1:40 a. m.  (EST) - White House says 'no agreement' reached between Trump and Kim as talks are cut shortTrump has returned to his hotel after negotiations with Kim were cut short.  The White House announced that \\\"no agreement\\\" was reached between the two leaders despite \\\"very good and constructive meetings. \\\"\\\"The two leaders discussed various ways to advance denuclearization and economic driven concepts,\\\" Sanders said in a statement.  \\\"No agreement was reached at this time, but their respective teams look forward to meeting in the future. \\\"Reporters were informed just an hour earlier that a previously scheduled 'Joint Agreement Signing Ceremony' was cancelled altogether, along with a photo-opportunity of a working lunch between the two delegations. The shortened talks appeared to catch the White House off guard, with the announcement coming after the press office had already sent reporters a menu for the lunch that was inevitably cancelled. Trump in recent days has seemed to lower expectations for in terms of announcing any concrete steps towards North Korea's denuclearization, though he hailed the talks as \\\"productive\\\" during a photo-op earlier in the day with Kim. Prior to his departure from Hanoi, Trump was expected to provide updates on the summit and will likely take questions on his former personal lawyer Michael Cohen's bombshell congressional testimony when he holds a press conference around 2 a. m.  E. T. 12:48 a. m.  (EST) - White House announces 'change of plans'After a significant delay in what was supposed to be a photo-op of the \\\"working lunch\\\" between the U. S.  and North Korean delegations, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders informed reporters of a significant change of plans. Sanders told reporters that the day of negotiations would wrap up in roughly 30 minutes, and that Trump would return to his hotel for a press conference two hours earlier than originally planned. It was not immediately clear whether the schedule change meant that the 'Joint Agreement Signing Ceremony' between Trump and Kim originally on the White House schedule had been scrapped altogether. 11:46 p. m.  (EST) – Kim indicates willingness to denuclearize, open US liaison office in PyongyangAnswering yet another round of questions from reporters, Kim seemed to indicate a willingness to rid his country of nuclear weapons, but also that he is open to the idea of a U. S.  liaison office in the North Korean capital of Pyongyang. When asked by a reporter if he was \\\"ready to denuclearize,\\\" Kim answered, \\\"if I'm not willing to do that I [wouldn’t] be here right now,\\\" according to an interpretation from his translator. The answer drew laughs in the room and seemed to surprise Trump, who has repeatedly softened expectations for what might come from the summit. \\\"That's a good answer, wow! \\\" Trump replied.  \\\"That might be the best answer you've ever heard. \\\"A reporter then followed up, asking if he was willing to take \\\"concrete steps\\\" to denuclearize, a sticking point for negotiators looking to gain access for inspections to North Korean facilities and a full accounting of its current arsenal. \\\"That is what we are discussing right now,\\\" Kim answered. \\\"And don't raise your voice, please,\\\" Trump added.  \\\"This isn't like dealing with Trump. \\\"The exchange seemed to amuse Kim. \\\"They all seem to be anxious,\\\" Kim said of the reporters. \\\"I think they're anxious and they're calm,\\\" Trump said. After some remarks from Trump, where he described their negotiations as \\\"productive,\\\" reporters again tried to engage the two leaders, with one asking whether Kim would be willing to allow the opening of a U. S.  consular office in Pyongyang. A member of the North Korean delegation then seemed to try and wave the press out of the room, but Trump used the moment to press the issue. \\\"It's actually an interesting question though,\\\" Trump said.  \\\"I would like to actually hear that answer, because it's actually not a bad idea. \\\"Kim then answered through his translator, saying, \\\"I think that is something which is welcomeable. \\\"Reporters were then ushered out of the room. 11:20 p. m.  (EST) - Kim takes more questions from reportersKim fielded some questions from Western reporters in Hanoi during his latest appearance with Trump. One journalist asked Kim if he’s \\\"ready to denuclearize. \\\"\\\"If I’m not willing do that I won’t be here right now,\\\" he said through an interpreter. Trump responded, \\\"That's a good answer. \\\"10:10 p. m.  (EST) - A history-making question?  Analysis from ABC News Chief White House Correspondent Jonathan KarlAs journalists were being escorted out of the first photo-op of the day between Kim and Trump, a reporter asked the North Korean leader a question. \\\"Chairman Kim, are you confident? \\\"There was a pause.  Would Kim take a question?  He turned back to look at his translator and listened. \\\"It's too early to tell,\\\" Kim said, looking at the reporters after hearing the translation.  \\\"I wouldn't jump to conclusions.  From what I feel right now, I do have a feeling that good results would come out. \\\"Maybe not a ground-breaking answer, but a historic one. This appears to be first time Kim has answered a question from the Western press.  His father never did that.  Nor did his grandfather. The moment followed controversy Tuesday, after the White House prevented a group of print reporters from attending a photo-op of Trump's dinner with Kim after the reporters attempted to ask questions of the leaders in a previous spray. 9:38 p. m.  (EST) - Trump, Kim complete their one-on-one bilateral meetingFollowing their one-on-one bilateral meeting, Trump and Kim walked together through a courtyard alongside a pool followed by their translators to join Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and DPRK Vice Chairman Kim Yong Chol. 9 p. m.  (EST) – Trump: \\\"When you have a good relationship a lot of good things happen\\\"Trump and Kim are holding a photo op at the Metropole hotel downtown. Trump briefly spoke about his \\\"good relationship\\\" with Kim ahead of their day of negotiations. \\\"A lot of good ideas being thrown about,\\\" Trump said.  \\\"When you have a good relationship a lot of good things happen. \\\"Trump also appeared to downplay the idea that any major action would result from the sit-down meeting, emphasizing that he's \\\"in no rush\\\" and highlighting what he described as significant economic opportunities for North Korea in the event Kim agrees to denuclearize. \\\"I can't speak necessarily for today, but a little bit longer term and over a period of time I know we’re going to have a fantastic success with respect to Chairman Kim and North Korea,\\\" Trump said.  \\\"I think it's going to be an economic powerhouse.  It is something I look forward to helping with, because with a little bit of help in the right location and the right place, I think it will be something very special. \\\"In what could be his first-ever exchange with a Western journalist, Kim briefly answered a Washington Post reporter's question who asked if he was \\\"confident\\\" about the negotiations. \\\"It's too early to tell,\\\" he said through his interpreter.  \\\"I wouldn't jump to conclusions.  From what I feel right now, I do have a feeling that good results would come out. \\\"Trump and Kim are scheduled to meet privately for 45 minutes before sitting down with their top diplomatic aides for a more extensive meeting. 8:55 p. m.  (EST) - What to expectWhether Kim has any interest in in an agreement remains the fundamental question at the heart of Trump's summit diplomacy, one that the U. S.  intelligence community and North Korea analysts have grave doubts about. The two have another personal meeting, joined only by their translators for 45 minutes, before a nearly two-hour long session with their negotiating teams.  In addition to Pompeo and Mulvaney, Trump is expected to be joined by U. S.  Special Representative for North Korea Stephen Biegun, who has been in Hanoi for the last week trying to reach an agreement for Trump and Kim to sign in a signing ceremony for a joint agreement, but it's unknown what that document will say. The last summit in Singapore was criticized for its joint declaration, which committed both countries to pursuing the \\\"complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula,\\\" a term that was never defined and means very different things to either side. For the U. S. , it's the unilateral disarmament of North Korea, including all its nuclear capabilities, ballistic missiles and chemical and biological weapons.  But North Korea has shown no interest in doing so, instead seeking sanctions relief and normalized relations with the U. S.  while handing over some small concessions, like inspections or verification of testing sites North Korea claims it has dismantled. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events\",\"document_ocr\":\"abcNEWS LIVE\\nBREAKING NEWS TRUMP AND KIM FACE-TO-FACE\\nPresident Trump and Kim Jong Un meeting now behind closed doors\\n\",\"Category\":\"Insufficient_Text\"},{\"Id\":34953,\"claim_image\":\"http://pbs.twimg.com/media/D0djQ41XcAA-hdH.jpg?format=jpg&name=large\",\"claim\":\"President Trump seeks a news reset with Kim Jong Un after Michael Cohen's testimony https://t.co/VRXpT2jt8o https://t.co/4xGjw32yb2\",\"claim_ocr\":\"\",\"document_image\":\"http://pbs.twimg.com/amplify_video_thumb/1100954917903220736/img/rHl-yeTKnPBtAj1A.jpg?format=jpg&name=large\",\"document\":\"Negotiations were wrapped up early and no agreement was reached.

Pakistan President Arif Alvi, who represented the country at the NAM Summit via video conference on Monday, used the occasion to criticise India for its handling of the situation in Jammu and Kashmir and for the alleged mistreatment of the Muslim minority. Responding to Alvi’s speech at the NAM Summit, one of the people cited above said on condition of anonymity: “Raising Kashmir at NAM is a well-established Pakistani propaganda exercise.  The international community is well aware of it and recognises that this is a propaganda exercise that they go through. ”The person added, “The international community is also well aware of our position on this issue and I don’t think we need to really dignify this with any response. ”In his speech, Alvi didn’t name India but referred to attempts to discriminate against and demonise Muslims in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic.  Speaking before Prime Minister Narendra Modi, he also referred to Islamophobia, hate speech, the “scapegoating” of a community and denial of medical facilities to this community in Pakistan’s “immediate neighbourhood”. Alvi, a close aide of Prime Minister Imran Khan, also highlighted the condition of the Kashmiri people and said their sufferings were compounded by a communications blackout and lack of unfettered access to medical and other essential facilities and high speed internet.  He also criticised what he said were efforts to change the demographic profile of the region. In his speech, Modi, without naming any country, said: “Even as the world fights Covid-19, some people are busy spreading other deadly viruses such as terrorism, fake news and doctored videos to divide communities and countries. ”\",\"document_ocr\":\"\",\"Category\":\"Insufficient_Text\"},{\"Id\":34956,\"claim_image\":\"http://pbs.twimg.com/media/D0NojZjX0AA7kWo.jpg?format=jpg&name=large\",\"claim\":\"One of the best #Oscars red carpet dresses was worn by 'Pose' star Billy Porter, in a Christian Siriano tuxedo gown https://t.co/215NCaSMbY https://t.co/UH73ZtWIrp\",\"claim_ocr\":\"\",\"document_image\":\"http://pbs.twimg.com/amplify_video_thumb/1099929110992830465/img/R0vyYVuklmY6fr_m.jpg?format=jpg&name=large\",\"document\":\"Pretty pink dresses were everywhere!

Adhikari joined the Bharatiya Janata Party in December, defecting from the Trinamool Congress, and his win in Nandigram was one of the few bright spots for the former in an election in which it hoped to win at least 200 seats and unseat Banerjee, but eventually ended up winning only 77. The TMC won 213, and while Banerjee, who lost to Adhikari by a margin of 1,900 votes demanded a recount, this was turned down by the Election Commission. Adhikari, who underwent training at Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) camps in his youth, started his career as a youth Congress leader before joining the TMC in 1998. “As leader of the opposition my first priority will be to carry out a movement to free Bengal of political violence and establish parliamentary democracy.  The killings and arson must stop,” said Adhikari. Also read | 43-member Bengal cabinet takes oathHis reference is to a spate of violence that has swept the state, with TMC workers allegedly targetting the political opposition, primarily the BJP but also Left Front workers. BJP national vice-president Mukul Roy, one of the founder members of the TMC and now a BJP national vice-president, proposed Adhikari’s name for the post of leader of the opposition when the BJP’s newly elected legislators met at the party’s election office at Hastings in south Kolkata on Monday afternoon.  Of the 77 BJP MLAs, 52 were present at the meeting while the rest were in their constituencies in the districts. Since Roy is senior to Adhikari and he won the polls from Krishnanagar in Nadia district, many leaders in the party thought he would be elected leader of the opposition.  But Roy brushed aside the speculations, saying, “I am too old. ” Roy is 67, and Adhikari, 51. “Twenty-two MLAs supported Suvendu Adhikari’s nomination.  I asked the others if they wanted to propose any other name.  Since there was no other nomination, Adhikari was unanimously elected leader of the BJP’s legislative party in the West Bengal assembly,” announced Union minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, who attended the meeting with the BJP’s central election observers. Manoj Tigga, who won the Natabari seat in north Bengal for the second time, was elected the BJP’s chief whip in the assembly. Asked why only 22 of the 52 BJP MLAs supported Adhikari’s nomination, BJP state president Dilip Ghosh said, “He was unanimously elected.  Even those who are in the districts told us that they would accept the party’s decision. ”TMC leaders declined comment on one of their former colleagues becoming leader of the opposition. Kolkata-based political science professor and poll analyst Udayan Bandopadhyay said, “Adhikari joined the BJP five months ago.  His becoming leader of the opposition may demoralise many leaders (in the BJP) who worked hard for years and helped the party grow in Bengal. ”Adhikari became a legislator for the first time in 2006 and was later elected to the Lok Sabha.  He was also made president of the TMC’s youth wing but Banerjee’s nephew Abhishek Banerjee replaced him in 2014.  His younger brother Dibyendu Adhikari is the TMC’s Lok Sabha member from Tamluk.  The youngest sibling, Soumendu, headed the Contai civic body before joining the BJP in January. Polls were held in 292 of Bengal’s 294 assembly seats.  Polls at two seats in Murshidababd district will be held later as two candidates died of Covid-19 during the polls, held in eight phases between March 27 and April 29. \",\"document_ocr\":\"P.\\n\",\"Category\":\"Insufficient_Text\"},{\"Id\":34958,\"claim_image\":\"http://pbs.twimg.com/media/Exp11WYWgAQMlrq.jpg?format=jpg&name=large\",\"claim\":\"The trial of former Minneapolis Police officer Derek Chauvin starts today, months after George Floyd's death under his knee led to widespread protests.

S.  criminal trial of the COVID-19 era is set to begin, and medical and legal experts said they expect the prosecution of Derek Chauvin for the death of George Floyd to unfold like no other. Fraught with both medical risks and judicial pitfalls for the participants, Minnesota court officials have taken extreme measures to keep the contagion from interfering with the pursuit of justice.  Attempting to COVID-proof the courtroom, officials have installed plexiglass partitions, ripped out the gallery to accommodate social distancing and are requiring the limited number of people allowed in to mask up. Everything from the airflow in the courtroom to the placement of hand sanitizer has been painstakingly detailed in a preparedness plan the Minnesota Judicial Branch has developed.  Even the judge presiding over the case, 61-year-old Peter Cahill, has felt compelled to tell jurors he has received his first COVID-19 vaccine shot. The opening statement's in the case are scheduled for Monday. \\\"It's going to be a case the likes of which none of us have seen before,\\\" David Weinstein, a former federal and state prosecutor in Florida, told ABC News.  \\\"It's a case that's so important on so many levels to so many people from different segments of society. \\\"Despite the COVID precautions being taken in the windowless 18th-floor courtroom of the Hennepin County Government Center in Minneapolis, Dr.  John Brownstein, an epidemiologist and chief innovation officer at Boston Children's Hospital, said the virus can still creep in and wreak havoc. \\\"It's all about balancing risk and there's no such thing as zero risks, but the steps they have taken with social distancing, barriers and masking clearly would drive risks way down,\\\" said Brownstein, a contributor to the ABC News Medical Unit.  \\\"It's definitely a test case for how one can lead trials in a moment of pandemic. \\\"In June, following a three-month COVID-prompted statewide shutdown of the courts, in-person criminal trials began to slowly resume in Hennepin County District Court and others throughout the state under a pilot program.  Administered by the Minnesota Judicial Branch, the program requires courtrooms to be certified for trials by adhering to an extensive COVID-19 Preparedness Plan -- a 13-page document providing guidelines on a plethora of precautions from seating jurors 6 feet apart to placing large-screen monitors in front of the panel to view exhibits, rather than handling them. Safeguards will also alter how private sidebar conferences are usually conducted, having them occur distantly via electronic headsets instead of at the judge's bench, according to the plan. \\\"We are committed to ensuring courts are doing everything we can to make the criminal jury trial experience safe.  As pilots have progressed we have been impressed with the commitment to duty shown by Minnesotans during these turbulent times,\\\" Minnesota Supreme Court Chief Justice Lorie S.  Gildea said in a statement. Minnesota State Public Defender Bill Ward told ABC News that for the most part, the pilot program has shown \\\"the sky has not fallen like, frankly, we all thought it was going to be, about a year ago. \\\"\\\"The biggest concern I had, and I would say most lawyers would have, was working with citizens who were afraid of being seated as jurors,\\\" Ward added.  \\\"If they felt that their safety was at risk due to a lack of spacing, or due to a lack of protection or cleaning of the areas, then they would not feel safe being on a jury. \\\"During the 11-day jury selection phase in the Chauvin case, potential jurors were interviewed individually about their worries over the virus.  After seeing measures taken in the courtroom, most said their concerns were eased by the reconfiguration of the courtroom to protect them. \\\"You can't be too careful,\\\" a prospective juror said. Ward said early results of the pilot program justified potential jurors' fears. \\\"We've had cases where people had symptoms after the trials had begun, where the cases were declared mistrials and had to start over again,\\\" Ward said. The first case tried in Hennepin Country under the pilot program had to be put on pause when the judge was forced to go in quarantine after being exposed to a staff member who tested positive for the virus, the Minneapolis Star Tribune reported. Ward, among the stakeholders who consulted on the courts' COVID-19 Preparedness Plan, said the fear factor still exists despite all the precautions. \\\"What we try to do as lawyers is have the jurors only focus on the case,\\\" Ward said, \\\"but the minute somebody coughs or sneezes, are they worried that they're going to contract the disease?  That became very concerning. \\\"Because of COVID restrictions on access to the courtroom, Cahill has allowed the Chauvin trial to be televised gavel to gavel, which would be the first such time in state history. \\\"The cameras are set up in a way that people can see and have the transparency of what's happening,\\\" Ward said.  \\\"But I think the real test cases are the ones where people aren't watching.  Those are the ones we have to be most concerned about to make sure my clients are being treated fairly and their families are being treated fairly as well. \\\"The case will be live-streamed, but it will not show jurors in order to protect their anonymity. Ward said his office has filed petitions asking the Judicial Branch to prevent counties that don't have courtrooms large enough to accommodate social distancing from using churches as courtrooms. \\\"We fought against that pretty vociferously because of the idea of the separation of church and state and, of course, the backgrounds of the jurors and of the accused,\\\" Ward said. Chauvin is facing charges of second-degree unintentional murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter stemming from Floyd's death on May 25, 2020.  He has pleaded not guilty. Because of concerns over COVID, Cahill ordered that Chauvin be tried separately from his three co-defendants, former Minneapolis police officers J.  Alexander Kueng, Thomas Lane and Tou Thao.  They're charged with aiding and abetting second-degree murder and manslaughter and are scheduled to go on trial in August.  They all have pleaded not guilty. The prosecution's key evidence in the case against all four men is a bystander video of the attempted arrest of Floyd.  Chauvin, who's white, is seen kneeling on the back of Floyd's neck for a prolonged amount of time as the handcuffed and prone Black man repeatedly cried out, \\\"I can't breathe\\\" before going unconscious.  Floyd, 46, initially was accused of trying to use a counterfeit $20 bill to buy cigarettes.  He later died at a hospital. \\\"It is an advantage to the other defendants in this case and a disadvantage to the government,\\\" Weinstein explained, \\\"because now there's less likely to be guilt by association because they're not sitting at the same table.  And the other co-defendants are now given a preview of what the government's case is going to look like. \\\"And if the jury doesn't convict Chauvin, Weinstein added, \\\"well then how in the world is the government going to proceed?  How do you proceed against people you're charging with aiding and abetting? \\\"Because of COVID restrictions, only one member at a time from Floyd's and Chauvin's families will be allowed to sit in the courtroom, and two media representatives will be permitted in to compile pool reports for reporters outside. Fifteen jurors have been picked for the panel, including three alternates.  Initially, the judge and lawyers had agreed to have just two alternates, but on Friday Cahill decided to add an additional alternate juror to ensure there are enough jurors to begin the trial. Cahill said one of the alternates will likely be dismissed on Monday as long as the others show up. Given the continuing COVID-19 crisis, Weinstein questioned whether moving forward with just two alternates will be enough to get through a long trial. \\\"What if during the trial a juror comes down with coronavirus?  With only two alternates that might or might not allow you to keep going,\\\" Weinstein said.  \\\"So now you're going to have to stop the trial for two weeks.  You're going to have to put the brakes on, put everybody into quarantine.  If that happens again, how many times is the judge going to be willing to let this case stop and start, stop and start, stop and start? \\\"As the trial commences, Weinstein said other COVID-related issues are sure to arise, including whether witnesses be allowed to keep their face masks on while testifying. During jury selection, Cahill allowed potential jurors to remove their masks while seated next to him in the witness box with a plexiglass partition between them.  Cahill has not said whether witnesses will be allowed to keep their masks on. \\\"A lot of what happens in a trial is not just the answer, but rather what's telegraphed when you're giving the answer or when you're asking the question,\\\" Weinstein said.  \\\"So if the judge is going to have these proceedings take place where a witness is going to wear a mask, then you're going to lose out on a lot of the way a person's face changes when he or she answers a question. \\\"Weinstein said that such a scenario could create an appellate issue on a confrontation clause by the defense, or at least objections along the lines of, 'Your honor, we object to the mask because it doesn't allow my client to confront, through me, the witness. '\\\"He said Chauvin's attorney, Eric Nelson, might even raise the issue in his closing argument. \\\"If I'm a defense attorney, I'm going to play that, 'Oh, everybody else took off their mask.  This witness didn't.  Don't read anything into it ladies and gentlemen, but did you see how they reacted.  What did they have to hide? '\\\"Ward, the Minnesota public defender, said the issue has come up in the pilot trials. \\\"I actually have a PowerPoint I could show you on different facial expressions that are hidden by masks,\\\" Ward said.  \\\"It is a concern.  The lawyers have made the arguments to allow the witness to lower their masks. \\\"Weinstein said both the prosecution and defense lawyers will be hamstrung when it comes to reading the faces of masked jurors spaced 6 feet apart to glean an indication of how they're reacting to a witness or a specific piece of evidence. During the trial, attorneys have been ordered to stand at a podium with a plexiglass shield attached, restricting lawyers from moving around as they speak. One of the most significant effects COVID will likely have on the trial is whether it will put a crimp on the camaraderie of the jury, especially during deliberations, Weinstein said. \\\"A traditional jury is packed into a jury box, 12 people, two to four alternates, all right on top of each other, all becoming one large family unit as the case progresses.  How is that going to occur in a pandemic when you're going to need to keep people socially distant from each other? \\\" Weinstein said.  \\\"That's going to play into the deliberations, that's going to play into how they're going to interact with each other, how willing they will be to listen to somebody else's opinion. \\\"24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events\",\"document_ocr\":\"Nicholas Pfosi/Reuters\\nMANies\\nLOSED\\nNO JUSTICE\\nNO STREETS GE\\nLIVES\\nHERE\\n\",\"Category\":\"Insufficient_Text\"},{\"Id\":34959,\"claim_image\":\"https://images.hindustantimes.com/rf/image_size_630x354/HT/p2/2020/08/06/Pictures/ram-mandir-bhoomi-pujan-celebrations_088adbc4-d786-11ea-a162-aa5ffaaa8aa4.jpg\",\"claim\":\"People lit earthen lamps in different parts of the country to celebrate the laying of the foundation stone of the Ram Temple in Ayodhya\\n\\nhttps://t.co/JAy9NhaQPK\",\"claim_ocr\":\"\",\"document_image\":\"http://pbs.twimg.com/media/EcE2sA9U4AAnXLz.jpg?format=jpg&name=large\",\"document\":\"People lit earthen lamps in different parts of the country to celebrate the laying of the foundation stone of the Ram Temple in Ayodhya, as government functionaries, irrespective of political affiliations, termed the event as a “historic moment” for every Indian. There was an air of accomplishment as workers of the Bharatiya Janata Party, the Rashtryia Swayamseval Sangh, and other affiliates of the latter blew conches when Prime Minister Narendra Modi performed ceremonial rituals at the sanctum sanctorum of the makeshift temple and placed a silver brick as the foundation for the new one.  BJP offices in various states were decorated and large screens were installed outside the offices to show the telecast of the ceremony -- carried live by almost every news channel in the country.  Party workers raised Jai Shri Ram and Jai Siya Ram slogansand after the ceremony, ladoos were distributed among people in several statesRam temples across India were done up for the occasion too, with even the streets leading to some in the country’s Hindi heartland decorated; special prayers were held in most.  Rains in several parts of the country including Ayodhya on Wednesday dampened the celebrations but not the sentiments.  In Raj Bhavans (the residence of the governors) in l states such as Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh, earthen lamps were lit and special prayers were held. Rajasthan governor Kalraj Mishra, a former BJP leader from Uttar Pradesh, hosted a recitation of the Sundara Kandam, one of the books of the Ramayan, and Sundarkand with his family members and lit 101 earthen lamps at the Raj Bhawan in Jaipur.  He said the commitment to build the Ram Temple has been fulfilled.  “The temple will be established as a symbol of cultural and national unity and with the spirit of ‘Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam (the world is one family)’. ”Governors of Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand Anandiben Patel and Baby Rani Maurya congratulated the Prime Minister.  “The dream of all Hindu believers has moved towards reality today,” Maurya said. Rajasthan chief minister and Congress leader Ashok Gehlot expressed hope that the temple would become a symbol of unity in the country. “His (Ram’s) life teaches us the importance of truth, justice, equality of all, compassion and brotherhood.  We need to focus on establishing an egalitarian society based on the values espoused by Lord Ram,” Gehlot tweeted.  Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh also tweeted a congratulatory message and said the temple would bring unit and prosperity in the country. West Bengal chief minister, Mamata Banerjee, who ordered complete lockdown in the state on Wednesday, citin the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic said, “Our country has always upheld the age-old legacy of unity in diversity, and we must preserve this to our last breath! ”West Bengal BJP president Dilip Ghosh claimed that several of its workers were arrested when they violated the lockdown restrictions to visit local temples in Bengal.  At Kharagpur in West Midnapore district police resorted to lathi charge after minor clashes with BJP workers.  “Mamata Banerjee is anti-Hindu,” Ghosh added.  Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khatter and Madhya Pradesh CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan termed the day , historic.  “This happy moment is historic for every Indian,” Khatter said; Chouhan added that the “dream of 500 years” has come true. The Ram temple will strengthen peace and humanity in the country, said Assam chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal.  “There was a long and hard struggle for 500 years.  But the power of Indian democratic values, judiciary and executive, under the leadership of PM Modi, has shown the world how solutions to problems can be found peacefully through democratic and constitutional means,” said UP chief minister Yodi Adityanath.

Failure to wear face covering in will attract a fine of 100 pounds under the new rules.  Ministers previously did not encourage masks.  Environment secretary George Eustice said: “It is about managing the overall risk.  Any type of covering will be sufficient for this purpose. ”The Office for National Statistics (ONS), which counts casualties on the basis of condition mentioned in death certificates, said coronavirus figured in 50,548 deaths between December 28 and July 3; of these, England accounted for 48,154 and Wales 2,470. The ONS count differs from that of the Department of Health, which releases figures of deaths and positive cases based on cases in hospitals and care homes.  The ONS count includes deaths from the virus in all settings. The figure of 50,548 does not include the dead in Scotland and Northern Ireland.  On Tuesday, Scotland reported that there were no deaths for six days in a row as the Scottish National Party government in Edinburgh continues its stricter approach to dealing with the pandemic compared to that in England. A new modelling commissioned by chief scientific adviser Patrick Vallance warned that the UK could see about 120,000 new coronavirus deaths in a second wave of infections this winter, the season when the country experiences a rise in hospital admissions and deaths. Experts who were asked to model a reasonable worst-case scenario suggested a range between 24,500 and 251,000 of virus-related deaths in hospitals alone, peaking in January and February, according to their paper released on Tuesday. Stephen Holgate of the University Hospital Southampton NHS Trust, who chaired the report, said: “This is not a prediction - but it is a possibility.  The modelling suggests that deaths could be higher with a new wave of Covid-19 this winter”. “But the risk of this happening could be reduced if we take action immediately,” he added. \",\"document_ocr\":\"Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme (IDSP)\\nmee ite fen\\nPublic Health Department, Maharashtra\\nCOVID-19 Related Updates\\nMedia Bulletin\\nDate - 25th July 2020\\nAt a glance:\\n• 7227 patients discharged today; 2,07,194 COVID-19 patients discharged after full\\nrecovery until today; Recovery rate in the state is 56.55%\\n• 9251 new cases in the state today\\n• 257 COVID-19 deaths reported in the state today.

The justices could, for the first time, establish a standard to decide when politicians go too far in drawing lines for partisan gain, or the court could slam the doors shut on such claims of extreme gerrymandering. \\n\\n  Chief Justice John Roberts suggested at one point that it would be hard for the court to police the use of partisanship in map drawing, when the process is intrinsically political.  Justice Samuel Alito emerged as the most vocal critic of the court’s involvement, often picking apart the manageability of tests that were presented to the court and worrying that every single dispute in the future would have to be resolved by the judiciary.   \\n\\n  Justice Brett Kavanaugh – whose vote could be key – said he would not “dispute” that extreme partisan gerrymandering has become a problem that was especially evident in a map drawn in his home state of Maryland.  But he also questioned if the courts should stay out of the issue because states are reacting with their own initiatives.  \\n\\n  It was a sentiment shared by Justice Neil Gorsuch, who said states have “provided remedies in this area. ” \\n\\nWhere John Roberts is unlikely to compromise\\n\\n  The liberal justices, on the other hand, suggested that they thought that the court could, for the first time, establish a workable standard. \\n\\n  Justice Stephen Breyer, perhaps sensing the reticence of the conservatives, suggested that the court could create a test that would target only those maps that represented what he called “outliers. ” \\n\\n  Such a test, Breyer said, would be “absolutely simple” and rule out the most blatant examples of politicians relying too heavily on party to draw maps.  Justice Elena Kagan said that maps drawn in Maryland were excessive under “any measure. ” \\n\\n  Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, an active participant at oral arguments, worried that under the current system, the impact of an individual’s vote could be “reduced” based on the voter’s party affiliation.  \\n\\n  Critics say that if the court decides to stay out of this issue, it will entrench the power of the party in charge of drawing the lines. \\n\\n  Last term, all eyes were on Justice Anthony Kennedy, who many believed was on the verge – for the first time – of articulating a judicial standard that courts could use going forward.  He was considered the swing vote.  While the conservatives on the bench suggested the issue should be left to the political branches, Kennedy had been unwilling to bar all future claims of injury from partisan gerrymander. \\n\\n  But ultimately the court sidestepped the merits of the cases and Kennedy retired – dashing the hopes of critics of extreme partisan gerrymandering, who thought he might be their last chance to stop politicians from illegally attempting to entrench power for one party over another. \\n\\n  Before the court now are two cases arising from North Carolina and Maryland.  One is brought by Democrats challenging Republican-drawn maps, the other is Republicans challenging a Democratic map.  The lower courts struck the maps and provided the justices with several potential tests grounded in the First Amendment, the Equal Protection Clause and other parts of the Constitution to establish a new standard. \\n\\n  “These cases are really about the representation we get in federal, state and local office all across the country,” said Justin Levitt, a professor of law at Loyola Law School, who has signed a brief in support of the challengers. \\n\\n  Rucho v.  Common Cause was brought by voting rights groups and Democratic voters, among others, who argue that North Carolina’s 2016 congressional districting plan was unconstitutional. \\n\\n  They say the map drawn by Republican legislators amounted to an unconstitutional partisan gerrymander that intentionally diluted the electoral strength of individuals who oppose Republicans.  \\n\\n  Allison Riggs of the Southern Coalition for Social Justice argued in court papers that the map drawers “divided clusters of Democrats that could have anchored congressional districts and submerged the fragments within larger masses of Republicans. ”\\n\\n  Riggs points out that Republicans won 53% of the vote in the 2016 election but they also won 10 of the 13 congressional seats. \\n\\n  Riggs warns the justices that if they don’t step in now, the use of politics will only get worse as map drawers rely increasingly on redistricting software that has become more sophisticated and studies show that the ideological gap between Democrats and Republicans in Congress is larger than ever before. \\n\\n  She said that if the Supreme Court rules that the issue must be left for the political branches, the 2016 plan will be the wave of the future. \\n\\n  “In the 2020 cycle and beyond, both parties will emulate – or exceed – its abuses, openly entrenching themselves in power using the full array of modern mapmaking technologies,” she said. \\n\\n  A lower court ruled in favor of the challengers on equal protection grounds, holding that certain districts discriminated against voters, and that the plan also violated the First Amendment, for punishing individuals based on how they had previously voted. \\n\\n  The other case, Lamone v.  Benisek, arises from Maryland.  A lower court blocked the map, holding that individuals in the district were retaliated against based on how they had voted, in violation of the First Amendment. \\n\\n  This case was brought by seven Republican voters, who argue that Democratic then-Gov.  Martin O’Malley, who was overseeing the redistricting process, took particular aim at the state’s 6th Congressional District.  \\n\\nThe inside story of how John Roberts negotiated to save Obamacare\\n\\n  “To that end, map drawers methodically dismantled the sixth district, breaking apart large swaths of territory dominated by rural Republicans and replacing them with smaller, densely populated areas dominated by suburban Democrats,” their lawyer, Michael Kimberly, argued in court papers. \\n\\n  The officials targeted some 66,000 Republicans in the district and added some 24,000 Democratic voters, therefore swinging the district, according to court documents.  \\n\\n  The challengers pointed to O’Malley’s own statements, when he said it was “also my intent to create a district where the people would be more likely to elect a Democrat than a Republican. ” \\n\\n  The justices should rule on both cases by the end of June. \\n© 2021 Cable News Network.

Breonna Taylor’s family attorney reacts to decisionProtests ignited in Louisville and swept across the U. S.  overnight as Americans unleashed outrage after a Kentucky grand jury indicted one officer for allegedly endangering the neighbors of Breonna Taylor during the police shooting that resulted in her death. Former Louisville officer Brett Hankison was indicted Wednesday on three counts of first-degree wanton endangerment for allegedly endangering Taylor's neighbors when he fired into the apartment complex. The neighboring apartment had three people inside, thus the three charges against Hankison, said Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron.  The other officers involved in Taylor's death were not charged. Taylor family attorney Ben Crump tweeted, \\\"NOTHING for the murder of Breonna Taylor.  This is outrageous and offensive! \\\"The news fueled protests in Louisville, where over 100 were arrested and two officers were shot.  Both officers' injuries were non-life-threatening. Protests, mostly peaceful, spread across the country. In New York City, hundreds of peaceful protesters gathered in Brooklyn and Manhattan. No one was arrested, according to ABC New York station WABC. Protests turned violent in Seattle when protesters violently clashed with authorities. Video captured a police officer who was walking his bicycle walk the bike over a protester who was lying on the ground. That officer has been placed on administrative leave and the incident has been sent to the King County Sheriff’s Office for a potential criminal investigation, said Seattle police. When protesters approached the East Precinct, someone threw an explosive that went through a gate and exploded near bike officers.  A few minutes later, wires that power the security cameras to the precinct were cut, police said. An unlawful assembly was declared after multiple fires were set and explosives were thrown at officers, according to police. \\\"Protestors continue to throw rocks, bottles, and even a fire extinguisher at officers,\\\" the Seattle police said. Multiple officers were injured, including one who was hit with a baseball bat, which cracked his helmet, according to police. Officers \\\"deployed pepper spray and blast balls,\\\" police said. More than a dozen people were arrested with charges ranging from property destruction, resisting arrest and assault on an officer, police said. In Buffalo, New York, a pickup truck hit a protester, authorities said. The victim was not seriously hurt, the Buffalo News reported. The victim was taken to a hospital, according to ABC Buffalo affiliate WKBW. The suspected driver was stopped by police, according to WKBW.  It's unclear whether the protester was hit intentionally. In Washington, D. C. , a crowd gathered at Black Lives Matter Plaza, near the White House. In Atlanta, demonstrators recited Taylor's name and chanted: \\\"What do we want? \\\" \\\"Justice! \\\" When do we want it? \\\" \\\"Now! \\\"After hours of protesting, a crowd headed to the Capitol Building, where Georgia State Patrol Troopers used tear gas to get people to disperse,reported ABC Atlanta affiliate WSB. Some people were arrested. In Denver, a man was detained for driving through a crowd of demonstrators, reported ABC Denver affiliate KMGH.  A protester hit by the car told The Denver Post she was not seriously hurt. Hundreds protested in Chicago, from the South Side to police headquarters. \\\"The grand jury today couldn't even say her name,\\\" said Father Michael Pfleger of St.  Sabina Church, reported ABC Chicago station WLS. \\\"When you take someone's life, it shouldn't matter who it is or who you are.  You should be held accountable,\\\" protester Teyonna Lofton told WLS. \\\"She didn't get the justice that she deserved,\\\" protester Anna Acosta added to WLS. A couch was set on fire in a street and officers put the blaze out, WLS reported. On the streets of Portland, a Molotov cocktail was thrown toward officers, police said. Portland police said an awning outside a precinct was lit on fire and \\\"multiple rocks\\\" were thrown, leaving substantial damage. Demonstrations also broke out in other cities, from Los Angeles to Nashville to Philadelphia. Many protesters across the country chanted \\\"say her name,\\\" a rallying cry to remember 26-year-old Taylor who was shot dead by police while in her Louisville home on March 13. Taylor and her boyfriend, Kenneth Walker, were asleep when three Louisville police officers, including Hankison, tried to execute a \\\"no-knock\\\" search warrant. The officers were investigating a suspected drug operation linked to Taylor's ex-boyfriend.  No drugs were found in the apartment. Walker contends he asked the officers to identify themselves as they tried to break open the door, but got no response, which prompted him to open fire with his licensed gun. Camerson said Detective Myles Cosgrove and Sgt.  Jonathan Mattingly were \\\"justified\\\" when they opened fire 22 times during the incident since they were returning fire. Mattingly was shot in the leg, according to Cameron. Cameron said no shots from Hankison struck Taylor. Hankison was fired and the other officers involved were placed on administrative duty.

Unveiling the new policy at the AP Industrial Infrastructure Corporation, state industries and infrastructure minister Mekapati Goutham Reddy said the core theme of the policy was to provide support to industries across the business value chain – from approvals to setting up industries, supporting their operations and scaling up their business.  The new industrial policy proposes to reimburse state GST to Medium, Large and Mega industrial units generating huge employment for a period of five years, provide special incentives for women entrepreneurs hailing from SC/ST/OBC communities and reserve 16. 2 per cent and 6 per cent of industrial plots for SC and ST entrepreneurs respectively.  The minister said the state government was contemplating establishment of a new initiative called “YSR AP One” by integrating different agencies like industrial development corporation, infrastructure corporation, economic development board and micro, small and medium enterprises corporation etc to extend as many as 10 services for entrepreneurs and industrialists under one roof.  “This new organisation would help entrepreneurs by providing handholding during pre-establishment and setting up of the industrial unit, extending post setup support, ensuring forward and backward linkages and accessing market and new technologies,” the minister said.  The “YSR AP One” will have 10 different wings such as entrepreneurship facilitation cell, market research cell, marketing and branding cell, sales support cell, scheme support cell, business enablement cell, investor reach-out cell, incentive management cell etc. , that would help entrepreneurs in various ways, he said.  The minister further said the state government had identified industrial zoning as a key focus area to ensure planned industrial development and provide a risk-free, investment-friendly environment for setting up and operating industries in the state with minimal impact on the environment.  “Mega industries will be allowed in industrial parks and independent locations as per the environment management plan.  Similarly, the government would develop industrial parks for MSMEs with all the facilities including ready-built factory shells.  The government has also proposed to make changes in the land allotment for industries.  In place of the existing lease and buy model, the government has introduced a composite lease and buy model, in which land is allotted to the industries on lease for a period of 33 years with an option of buying the land after 10 years of successful business operations.  Stating that the manufacturing sector as an employment provider continues to be top priority for the state government, Gautam Reddy said the government would undertake structural reforms to accelerate industrialisation in the state.  “We believe that providing the right facilities at the right cost and offering transparent approvals is critical to the success of the industrial sector,” the minister said.  \",\"document_ocr\":\"\",\"Category\":\"Insufficient_Text\"},{\"Id\":34964,\"claim_image\":\"http://pbs.twimg.com/media/D0N1qIwWwAAhthR.jpg?format=jpg&name=large\",\"claim\":\"The Oscar for best costume design went to Ruth Carter, and in her own words, it was \\\"a long time coming.\\\" Carter won for \\\"Black Panther\\\" and became the first African American to take home the statue. https://t.co/9KGOWwKBl1 #Oscars https://t.co/LVaMf5Ze4y\",\"claim_ocr\":\"\",\"document_image\":\"http://pbs.twimg.com/tweet_video_thumb/D0No9PhVYAAlFLC.jpg?format=jpg&name=large\",\"document\":\"It was a rocking way to open Hollywood's biggest night. Oscars 2019: 'Bohemian Rhapsody,' 'Green Book' take home multiple awardsFor the first time in three decades, the 2019 Oscars has begun without a host. Usually the show opens with a monologue about current events, politics and of course, the nominees. But instead, Adam Lambert and Queen opened the show with \\\"We Will Rock You,\\\" then moved into another one of their hits, \\\"We Are the Champions. \\\"It was a moment of true chills as Lambert sung the iconic words, \\\"no time for losers\\\" because \\\"We are the champions of the world. \\\"The band had Bradley Cooper, Jennifer Lopez and others singing along and jamming out with them.  The performance closed with a shot of the band's legendary former lead singer Freddie Mercury. \\\"Welcome to the Oscars! \\\" Lambert then shouted. Next, there was a montage of some of the movies of 2018, including \\\"The Favourite,\\\" \\\"Deadpool 2,\\\" \\\"Black Panther,\\\" \\\"Roma,\\\" \\\"Vice\\\" and more. It closed with a voice-over from Mister Rogers from the acclaimed documentary, \\\"Won't You Be My Neighbor. \\\"But the open was not done yet! A comedy dream team of Tina Fey, Amy Poehler and Maya Rudolph stepped out to present outstanding supporting actress. \\\"We are not your hosts, but we are going to stand here a little too long,\\\" Tina Fey joked about the lack of an MC.  \\\"So, that the people who get USA Today tomorrow will think we have hosted. \\\"They gave a mini monologue like a host would have delivered (but instead with three hilarious women) with repeated jokes about not being the hosts for the night, on President Donald Trump's wall and even current events like the Fyre Festival, telling the audience to look under their seats for the infamous cheese sandwich from the failed music event.  Then it was right into the nominees for best supporting actress. Poehler also said of the category that all women are supporting because \\\"women naturally support each other. \\\"Kevin Hart had been named the host of the Oscars back in December, but the funnyman stepped down just hours later, after homophobic tweets he posted almost eight years ago resurfaced. In January, Hart apologized again to the LGBTQ community, adding, \\\"We thought it was OK to talk like that, because that’s how we talked to one another . . .  This is wrong now. \\\"He later said on \\\"GMA\\\" that \\\"There's no more conversation about it . . .  I'm over that, I'm over the moment\\\" when asked about the Oscars and his past comments. Also in February, Hart's good friend Dwayne \\\"The Rock\\\" Johnson said he was offered the gig before Hart, but had to turn it down to shoot a movie. The last time the Oscars went without a host was 1989, when producer Allan Carr decided on having more presenters instead of an MC.  That show had a kitschy open that featured actor Rob Lowe and Snow White singing a duet.  It did not do well with fans and critics. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events\",\"document_ocr\":\"abc\\n\",\"Category\":\"Insufficient_Text\"},{\"Id\":34965,\"claim_image\":\"http://pbs.twimg.com/media/EuA-ilPVkAgVdPc.jpg?format=jpg&name=large\",\"claim\":\".@MoHFW_INDIA gets fake website charging ₹4K to ₹6K for #COVID19 vaccines blocked\\n\\nhttps://t.co/Pu6uufPfCe https://t.co/Gb9yODxeoO\",\"claim_ocr\":\"as This Website is Fake!\\nA Not secure mohfw.xyz\\nAppointment for vaccination\\nclick to\\nFAKE\\nActve\\nDiacharned\\nAKE\\n\",\"document_image\":\"http://pbs.twimg.com/media/Ez9P-tCUYAQlgSl.png?format=jpg&name=large\",\"document\":\"A fake website impersonating the official website of the ministry of health and family welfare claiming to offer vaccines against Covid-19 has come to the notice of the ministry and it has been immediately blocked to stop the spread of misinformation regarding India's vaccination process.

This is not the first time that fraudulent activities surrounding the vaccination process came to the notice of the authorities.  Before the Co-WIN app was launched, fraudulent apps with the same name cropped up to guile people.  Such activities are likely to pick up pace as India starts to vaccinate people above 50 years as there is an option of self-registration in that phase. The vaccination drive in India began on January 16, starting with healthcare staff and now dovetailing into the phase where other frontline staff are being inoculated.  All these beneficiaries have been pre-registered with the Co-WIN app based on the data provided by the state governments.  For the next phase where people above 50 years of age will be vaccinated, data have been sourced from local authorities and electoral rolls.  But one can also self-register and this leeway is likely to be exploited by fraudsters. \",\"document_ocr\":\"ORDER\\nIn the background of the rising numberof COVID-19 cases and in order to ensure that all\\nCOVID-19 infected patients get due health care , all the private / government hospitals of\\nDistrict Dehradun are hereby ordered to follow the below mentioned Standard Operating\\nProcedure for admission into their facility duly notified as DCCC, DCHC and DCH by the State\\nGovernment.\\nStandard Operating Procedure ( SOP) for admission to be followed\\nA.

Two men died in the country's most populous state of New South Wales (NSW) days after getting their coronavirus vaccine shots, Australian media reported. A 71-year-old man with several underlying health conditions died days after getting AstraZeneca's vaccine, Seven News reported.  A 55-year-old man died eight days after getting his vaccine, a regional newspaper in NSW's northwest town of Tamworth said in a report, citing his family. The reporting of an adverse event after vaccination does not mean it was caused by the doses, TGA said in an emailed reply.  It did not specify when the deaths happened, citing patient confidentiality reasons, or the type of shots they received. Australia's immunisation drive includes AstraZeneca and Pfizer vaccines but earlier this month authorities abandoned a goal to vaccinate its near 26 million population by the end of 2021 after finding possible links between the AstraZeneca vaccine and blood clots. Australia, which had banked on the AstraZeneca vaccine for the majority of its shots, recommended the doses should only be given to people above 50 years, throwing its vaccination programme into disarray. Two weeks ago, the country reported its first death from blood clots linked to the AstraZeneca vaccine after the medicines regulator said a 48-year-old woman's fatality was \\\"likely\\\" linked to the shot. Australia has largely avoided the high COVID-19 numbers seen in other developed countries, with just over 29,700 cases and 910 deaths since the pandemic began, but its vaccination rollout has hit several roadblocks. More than 2 million total vaccine doses have been administered as of Tuesday, far short of the 4 million pledged by the end of March.

Democratic leaders question the conclusiveness of Barr's summary on Mueller reportHouse Democrats on Monday demanded that the Justice Department turn over the full report from special counsel Robert Mueller to Congress by next Tuesday, while also requesting Attorney General William Barr's appearance before lawmakers. The move to escalate the fight over Mueller's findings could be followed with subpoenas, signaling Democrats plans to continue investigations even as President Trump and Republicans have declared victory after Mueller found that the Trump campaign did not conspire with the Kremlin in the 2016 election, according to Barr's summary of Mueller's findings sent to Capitol Hill Sunday. \\\"There are a lot of open questions,\\\" House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif. , said Monday.   “These questions have not been answered by the summary we got from Bill Barr.  I would hope that there are answers in the Mueller report.  Now those answers, I imagine, don’t amount to proof beyond a reasonable doubt of a crime.  But they are concerning nonetheless, particularly as they shed light on whether there is any form of compromise on these individuals. \\\"Their continued focus on the investigations could hurt Democrats politically, following the end of the Mueller investigation, as Republicans continue to accuse them of overreach. \\\"They need to get over it but they won’t get over it,\\\" House Republican Whip Steve Scalise, R-La. , told ABC News.  \\\"They’re still going to keep harassing the president. \\\"Democrats have taken issue with Barr’s obstruction of justice determination, citing a memo that he sent to the Justice Department before his confirmation arguing it would be \\\"fatally misconceived\\\" that Trump's firing of FBI Director James Comey could be the basis of an obstruction of justice inquiry. \\\"His conclusions raise more questions than they answer,\\\" House Judiciary Committee Chairman Rep.  Jerry Nadler, D-N. Y. , said Sunday.  \\\"The American people are entitled to a full accounting of the president's misconduct referenced by the special counsel. \\\"Mueller, according to Barr's summary, did not find that the Trump campaign officials or any associated with it conspired or coordinated with the Russian government to influence the 2016 election.  Barr also revealed Mueller's conclusion on obstruction, that \\\"while this report does not conclude that the president committed a crime, it also doesn't exonerate him,\\\" and said the special counsel set out evidence on \\\"both sides of the question. \\\"\\\"Given Mr.  Barr’s public record of bias against the Special Counsel’s inquiry, he is not a neutral observer and is not in a position to make objective determinations about the report,\\\" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said in a joint statement. Trump and Republicans on Capitol Hill celebrated Mueller's conspiracy conclusion, arguing that it vindicated the president. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif. , said in a statement Sunday that the findings meant  the \\\"case is closed\\\" on the matters investigated by Mueller, a conclusion rejected by Democrats. “This is just the beginning,” Rep.  Eric Swalwell, D-Calif. , a member of the House Judiciary and Intelligence Committees, told ABC News Sunday afternoon.  \\\"It’s case closed criminally but not case closed as to whether the president committed a high crime or misdemeanor. \\\"Rep.  Matt Gaetz, R-Florida, a Trump ally and member of the House Judiciary Committee, argued that Democrats’ focus on the Russia probe would hurt their standing with the public. “We will be able to show that this batch of Democrats that had been telling lies about the president for 22 months, cannot be trusted,” he said, previewing Republicans’ message ahead of the 2020 presidential election.  “They can't be trusted on healthcare, on infrastructure, on education, because they came here to Washington insisting that there was this Russia collusion.  They've spent all their time on that narrative, it's proven to be false. “And I think the American people see who's fighting for them in this president, and who's just trying to create a distraction that ultimately was disproven. ”Nadler and five House Democratic chairs asked the Justice Department for the full Mueller report by next week, and for the underlying evidence to be transmitted to Congress beginning on, April 2.  The House Judiciary Committee has also asked Barr to appear before the panel to testify, according to Judiciary Committee members, who met privately on Monday evening with the committee's special oversight counsels to plot out the path forward. In a statement with Schiff and House Oversight Committee Chairman Elijah Cummings, he said it was \\\"unacceptable that, after Special Counsel Mueller spent 22 months meticulously uncovering this evidence, Attorney General Barr made a decision not to charge the President in under 48 hours,\\\" and did so without interviewing Trump. Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, who also said he wanted Barr to testify, stood by the attorney general’s conclusions on Monday, and said he wanted his committee to investigate the handling of the Russia counterintelligence investigation. The attorney general is also expected to appear before the House Appropriations Committee for a budget hearing on April 9, according to a committee aide, giving Democrats another opportunity to question him about the Mueller investigation.

Dear Chairman Graham, Chairman Nadler, Ranking Member Feinstein, and Ranking Member Collins:As a supplement to the notification provided on Friday, March 22, 2019, I am writing today to advise you of the principal conclusions reached by Special Counsel Robert S.  Mueller III and to inform you about the status of my initial review of the report he has prepared. On Friday, the Special Counsel submitted to me a \\\"confidential report explaining the prosecution or declination decisions\\\" he has reached, as required by 28 C. F. R.  § 600. 8(c).  This report is entitled \\\"Report on the Investigation into Russian Interference in the 2016 Presidential Election. \\\" Although my review is ongoing, I believe that it is in the public interest to describe the report and to summarize the principal conclusions reached by the Special Counsel and the results of his investigation. The report explains that the· Special Counsel and his staff thoroughly investigated allegations that members of the presidential campaign of Donald J.  Trump, and others associated with it, conspired with the Russian government in its efforts to interfere in the 2016 U. S.  presidential election, or sought to obstruct the related federal investigations.  In the report, the Special Counsel noted that, in completing his investigation, he employed 19 lawyers who were assisted by a team of approximately 40 FBI agents, intelligence analysts, forensic accountants, and other professional staff.  The Special Counsel issued more than 2,800 subpoenas, executed nearly 500 search warrants, obtained more than 230 orders for communication records, issued almost 50 orders authorizing use of pen registers, made 13 requests to foreign governments for evidence, and interviewed approximately 500 witnesses. The Special Counsel obtained a number of indictments and convictions of individuals and entities in connection with his investigation, all of which have been publicly disclosed.  During the course of his investigation, the Special Counsel also referred several matters to other offices for further action.  The report does not recommend any further indictments, nor did the Special Counsel obtain any sealed indictments that have yet to be made public.  Below, I summarize the principal conclusions set out in the Special Counsel's report.  AG March 24 2019 Letter to House and Senate Judiciary Committees by ABC News Politics on ScribdRussian Interference in the 2016 U. S.  Presidential Election.  The Special Counsel's report is divided into two parts.  The first describes the results of the Special Counsel's investigation into Russia's interference in the 2016 U. S.  presidential election.  The report outlines the Russian effort to influence the election and documents crimes committed by persons associated with the Russian government in connection with those efforts.  The report further explains that a primary consideration for the Special Counsel's investigation was whether any Americans -including individuals associated with the Trump campaign - joined the Russian conspiracies to influence the election, which would be a federal crime.  The Special Counsel's investigation did not find that the Trump campaign or anyone associated with it conspired or coordinated with Russia in its efforts to influence the 2016 U. S.  presidential election.  As the report states: \\\"[T]he investigation did not establish that members of the Trump Campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities. \\\"[Footnote from letter: In assessing potential conspiracy charges, the Special Counsel also considered whether members of the Trump campaign \\\"coordinated\\\" with Russian election interference activities.  The Special Counsel defined \\\"coordination\\\" as an \\\"agreement-tacit or express-between the Trump Campaign and the Russian government on election interference. \\\"]The Special Counsel's investigation determined that there were two main Russian efforts to influence the 2016 election.  The first involved attempts by a Russian organization, the Internet Research Agency (IRA), to conduct disinformation and social media operations in the United States designed to sow social discord, eventually with the aim of interfering with the election.  As noted above, the Special Counsel did not find that any U. S.  person or Trump campaign official or associate conspired or knowingly coordinated with the IRA in its efforts, although the Special Counsel brought criminal charges against a number of Russian nationals and entities in connection with these activities. The second element involved the Russian government's efforts to conduct computer hacking operations designed to gather and disseminate information to influence the election.  The Special Counsel found that Russian government actors successfully hacked into computers and obtained emails from persons affiliated with the Clinton campaign and Democratic Party organizations, and publicly disseminated those materials through various intermediaries, including WikiLeaks.  Based on these activities, the Special Counsel brought criminal charges against a number of Russian military officers for conspiring to hack into computers in the United States for purposes of influencing the election.  But as noted above, the Special Counsel did not find that the Trump campaign, or anyone associated with it, conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in these efforts, despite multiple.  offers from Russian-affiliated individuals to assist the Trump campaign. Obstruction of Justice.  The report's second part addresses a number of actions by the President - most of which have been the subject of public reporting - that the Special Counsel investigated as potentially raising obstruction-of-justice concerns.  After making a \\\"thorough factual investigation\\\" into these matters, the Special Counsel considered whether to evaluate the conduct under Department standards governing prosecution and declination decisions but ultimately determined not to make a traditional prosecutorial judgment.  The Special Counsel therefore did not draw a conclusion - one way or the other - as to whether the examined conduct constituted obstruction.  Instead, for each of the relevant actions investigated, the report sets out evidence on both sides of the question and leaves unresolved what the Special Counsel views as \\\"difficult issues\\\" of law and fact concerning whether the President's actions and intent could be viewed as obstruction . .  The Special Counsel states that \\\"while this report does not conclude that the President committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him. \\\"The Special Counsel's decision to describe the facts of his obstruction investigation without reaching any legal conclusions leaves itto the Attorney General to determine whether the conduct described in the report constitutes a crime.  Over the course of the investigation, the Special Counsel's office engaged in discussions with certain Department officials regarding many of the legal and factual matters at issue in the Special Counsel's obstruction investigation.  After reviewing the Special Counsel's final report on these issues; consulting with Department officials, including the Office of Legal Counsel; and applying the principles of federal prosecution that guide our charging decisions, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and I have concluded that the evidence developed during the Special Counsel's investigation is not sufficient to establish that the President committed an obstruction-of-justice offense.  Our determination was made without regard to, and is not based on, the constitutional considerations that surround the indictment and criminal prosecution of a sitting president. [Footnote from letter:  See A Sitting President's Amenability to Indictment and Criminal Prosecution, 24 Op.  O. L. C.  222 (2000). ]In making this determination, we noted that the Special Counsel recognized that \\\"the evidence does not establish that the President was involved in an underlying crime related to Russian election interference,\\\" and that, while not determinative, the absence of such evidence bears upon the President's intent with respect to obstruction.  Generally speaking, to obtain and sustain an obstruction conviction, the government would need to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that a person, acting with corrupt intent, engaged in obstructive conduct with a sufficient nexus to a pending or contemplated proceeding.  In cataloguing the President's actions, many of which took place in public view, the report identifies no actions that, in our judgment, constitute obstructive conduct, had a nexus to a pending or contemplated proceeding, and were done with corrupt intent, each of which, under the Department's principles of federal prosecution guiding charging decisions, would need to be proven beyond a reasonable doubt to establish an obstruction-of¬justice offense. 37,040-41 (July 9, 1999).  As I have previously stated, however, I am mindful of the public interest in this matter.  For that reason, my goal and intent is to release as much of the Special Counsel's report as I can consistent with applicable law, regulations, and Departmental policies. Based on my discussions with the Special Counsel and my initial review, it is apparent that the report contains material that is or could be subject to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 6( e ), which imposes restrictions on the use and disclosure of information relating to \\\"matter[ s] occurring before [a] grand jury. \\\" Fed.  R.  Crim.  P.  6(e)(2)(B).  Rule 6(e) generally limits disclosure of certain grand jury information in a criminal investigation and prosecution.  Id.  Disclosure of 6( e) material beyond the strict limits set forth in the rule is a crime in certain circumstances.  See, e. g. , 18 U. S. C.  § 401(3).  This restriction protects the integrity of grand jury proceedings and ensures that the unique and invaluable investigative powers of a grand jury are used strictly for their intended criminal justice function. Given these restrictions, the schedule for processing the report depends in part on how quickly the Department can identify the 6( e) material that by law cannot be made public.  I have requested the assistance of the Special Counsel in identifying all 6( e) information contained in the report as quickly as possible.  Separately, I also must identify any information that could impact other ongoing matters, including those that the Special Counsel has referred to other offices.  As soon as that process is complete, I will be in a position to move forward expeditiously in determining what can be released in light of applicable law, regulations, and Departmental policies. As I observed in my initial notification, the Special Counsel regulations provide that \\\"the Attorney General may determine that public release of' notifications to your respective Committees \\\"would be in the public interest. \\\" 28 C. F. R.  § 600. 9(c).  I have so determined, and I will disclose this letter to the public after delivering it to you. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events\",\"document_ocr\":\"The Attorney General\\nWashington, D.C.\\nMarch 24, 2019\\nThe Honorable Jerrold Nadler\\nThe Honorable Lindsey Graham\\nChairman, Committee on the Judiciary\\nChairman, Committee on the Judiciary\\nUnited States House of Representatives\\n2132 Rayburn House Office Building\\nWashington, D.C. 20515\\nUnited States Senate\\n290 Russell Senate Office Building\\nWashington, D.C. 20510\\nThe Honorable Doug Collins\\nRanking Member, Committee on the Judiciary\\nUnited States House of Representatives\\n1504 Longworth House Office Building\\nWashington, D.C. 20515\\nThe Honorable Dianne Feinstein\\nRanking Member, Committee on the Judiciary\\nUnited States Senate\\n331 Hart Senate Office Building\\nWashington, D.C. 20510\\nDear Chairman Graham, Chairman Nadler, Ranking Member Feinstein, and Ranking Member\\nCollins:\\nAs a supplement to the notification provided on Friday, March 22, 2019, I am writing today\\nto advise you of the principal conclusions reached by Special Counsel Robert S.

The government announced the new measures on Thursday after a jump in Covid-19 cases in Paris and parts of northern France. The new restrictions are less severe than those in place during the lockdowns of spring and November 2020, raising concerns that they may not be effective.    \\\"I hope it's going to end quite quickly, although I have questions on how efficient the measures are,\\\" Kasia Gluc, 57, a graphic editor said on the Champs Elysees avenue in Paris. There was frustration among so-called non-essential shop owners forced to close down. Stores allowed to stay open include those selling food, books, flowers and chocolate as well as hairdressers and shoemakers, but not clothes, furniture and beauty shops, according to a list released on Friday evening. Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire, who said a total of 90,000 shops would need to close down, defended the list of stores that could remain open, notably those selling chocolate and flowers just two weeks ahead of Easter. \\\"I do not at all say that this is ideal, but each time it is done with a simple logic: guarantee the health of the French people while preserving economic activity and shops as much as possible,\\\" he told France Inter radio.

Remembering Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader GinsburgThree days of public mourning for Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, a champion of equality and pioneer of women's rights, began Wednesday when her casket arrived at the Supreme Court for a dramatic procession up the steps lined by more than a hundred of her former law clerks. Her casket was placed on the Lincoln Catafalque, once used for President Abraham Lincoln, before a ceremony inside the court's Great Hall attended by family, friends and her fellow justices, all wearing masks. Chief Justice John Roberts spoke, calling her a \\\"fighter\\\" for equal justice and saying \\\"her voice was soft, but when she spoke, people listened. \\\"Roberts, who sat next to Ginsburg on the Supreme Court bench, said her life was a reflection of the American Dream, noted her love of opera and called her \\\"a star\\\" who \\\"found her stage in our courtroom. \\\"One of her \\\"many virtues\\\" that defined her time on the bench, he said, was her \\\"humility. \\\"\\\"The court was her family, too.

Then, in an unprecedented move, because of the pandemic, her casket was brought outside and placed at the top of the court steps under the portico so members of the public could pay their respects. There has been an outpouring of public support at the court since word of Ginsburg's death at age 87 came Friday night.  With warm, sunny weather in Washington on Wednesday, large crowds were expected. Some of those who came to honor her wore \\\"Notorious RBG\\\" shirts, the nickname she became known by to her devoted supporters. Many who gazed at her flag-draped casket from the bottom of the court steps were women and girls. Mourners had started to gather early Wednesday morning near the court steps, where there had been a makeshift memorial of flowers and messages in remembrance of the impact she has had on people's lives in her almost 30 years as a liberal icon on the nation's high court. The memorial, which wrapped around the building, was cleared away overnight -- some was collected by the court curator and other items were donated to Ginsburg's family or interested museums. Ginsburg will lie in repose at the Supreme Court through Thursday.  The public outdoor viewings continue Wednesday until 10 p. m.  and resume Thursday from 9 a. m.  until 10 p. m. The White House announced that President Donald Trump would go to the court Thursday to pay his respects. Among those paying their respects on Wednesday were Vice President Mike Pence, second lady Karen Pence, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and former President Bill Clinton -- who nominated Ginsburg to the bench in 1993. On Friday, Ginsburg will lie in state at the Capitol, the first woman in U. S.  history to be so honored, at the direction of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Nearby in the Capitol, a bitter political battle continued over her replacement. She will be interred next week beside her husband of 56 years at Arlington National Cemetery.

A fireworks display lit up the sky above the Washington Monument at the conclusion of his remarks. Highlights from the final night of the RNC:12:48 a. m.  Trump squares off with his own America as GOP convention concludes: ANALYSISOn the final night of the Republican National Convention, as protesters massed outside the White House that was transformed into a grand political backdrop, President Donald Trump offered a sentiment the nation actually can unite behind. \\\"At no time before have voters faced a clearer choice between two parties, two visions, two philosophies or two agendas,\\\" the president said Thursday, in accepting the Republican nomination for a second time with a meandering and searing speech. It would have been a jarring scene in any moment -- bright lights and big \\\"TRUMP-PENCE\\\" signs on the South Lawn of the White House, as a giant political rally was held at the most famous residence in the United States. The messaging, too, would be discordant in any time -- descriptions of American rot and violence joined by urgent pleas to reelect the president. But this is not just any moment.  It's a tense, angry, conflicted time, amid the biggest pandemic and most sudden economic collapse in a century, and unfolding reckonings around race and policing. Read more from ABC News Political Director Rick Klein's analysis:12:44 a. m.  3 key takeaways from night 4 of the Republican National ConventionThe Republican National Convention came to a close Thursday, but not before remarks from some of the nation's most prominent conservatives, including the party's congressional leaders, President Donald Trump's daughter -- and White House adviser -- and the chief executive himself. The night brought a close to two weeks of unprecedented political conventions but also kick started the presidential campaign's homestretch, reaffirming several of the themes likely to play a major role in the successes and failures of those on the ballot in November. Here are the key takeaways from night four of the RNC:12:37 a. m.  Unprecedented wave of GOP defections as Trump re-nominated: ANALYSISWhat started as a trickle of \\\"Never Trumpers\\\" has turned into a historic wave of defections from high-profile Republicans. By the close of the 2020 Republican National Convention, nearly 500 current and former GOP officials have gone public opposing a second term for the president of their own party. \\\"Absolutely unprecedented; nothing remotely like it,\\\" said presidential historian Mark Updegrove. The divide over President Donald Trump and Trumpism has raised existential questions for Republicans both about party identity and loyalty. \\\"It's become the party of Donald Trump and any whim he has,\\\" Updegrove said.  \\\"It's about personality and not political party or platform. \\\"While nine in 10 Republican voters approve of Trump as president, opposition to his leadership inside the party establishment has mushroomed.

The striking contrast between the Democratic and Republican conventionsAfter testing every staff member, reporter and individual near the former vice president for two days in a row and asking members of the crowd to stay in or near their socially distanced cars Joe Biden and his wife still wore masks as they watched fireworks together, away from the cheering audience after his acceptance speech at the Democratic National Convention in Delaware last week. In terms of their approach to coronavirus safety, Democrats and Republicans have largely followed different standards, resulting in strikingly different images over the course of their two conventions. On the third night of the Republican National Convention, for instance, President Trump and Vice President Mike Pence stepped down from the stage at the Fort McHenry National Monument and greeted the crowd of a few hundred supporters.  While they did not shake everyone's hands, they did not wear masks.  Pence could be seen giving a fist-bump to at least one member of the crowd. The conventions were, in many ways, a culmination of diverging views and campaigning norms that had been on display for the two parties for months.   did not wear masks.  Pence could be seen giving a fist-bump to at least one member of the crowd. Read more:-- ABC News Deputy Political Director MaryAlice Parks12:21 a. m.  Biden responds to Trump's acceptance speechThe Biden campaign is once again criticizing Trump on the coronavirus pandemic, tallying the number of Americans lost to COVID-19 over the four days of the RNC and deriding Trump for delivering “a delusional vision” of the country, rather than articulating his vision for dealing with the pandemic -- something Biden’s Deputy Campaign Manager Kate Bedingfield said would not come as a surprise to the American people. “Since the beginning of the Republican convention, at least 3,525 Americans have lost their lives to the coronavirus.  Over those four days -- and for the last eight months -- the American people have waited in exasperation for a plan to finally take control of the pandemic that has cost us 180,000 lives, infected almost six million, and thrown working families and our middle class into dire financial straits, but nothing came,” Bedingfield wrote in the statement. “Instead of a strategy to overcome the pandemic, or any concern for the unbearable suffering in our country right now as a result of his ongoing failures, what we heard was a delusional vision completely divorced from the crushing reality that ordinary Americans face.  But the American people know who Donald Trump is.  They know the truth about Trump’s crisis-plagued presidency because they are living it every single day: shuttered businesses in our neighborhoods, kids kept home from school, and a steady stream of vitriol intended to tear us apart, from the person who is supposed to be uniting our nation. \\\"--ABC News' Molly Nagle11:44 p. m.  Fireworks display at the Washington MonumentAt the conclusion of Trump's acceptance speech, a fireworks display launched at the Washington Monument. 11:43 p. m.  'I'm here and they're not' Trump highlights White House as backdrop at RNCTrump made a point to emphasize that he was in the White House, and physically outside it, in making a contrast between him and Biden. \\\"We must turn the page forever on this failed political class.  The fact is, I'm here,\\\" Trump said, turning and pointing at the White House, \\\"the fact is, we're here and they're not.  And that's because of you. \\\"The use of the White House for the convention event has raised ethical concerns, including that it could violate a federal law that bans government employees from using their office for political activity or personal gain.  The president and vice president are exempt from that law -- the Hatch Act -- but the RNC events at the White House and National Park Service properties still garnered criticism it blurred the lines for other administration employees involved in the events. The Hatch Act is intended to prevent abuses of power, bribery and coercion by officials in public office. Multiple Trump administration officials, including counselor to the president Kellyanne Conway, have been cited for repeated and knowing violations of the Hatch Act, but enforcement of violations is left to the individual's employer and no action has been taken in those cases. -- ABC News' Stephanie Ebbs11:35 p. m.  Trump says election a choice between law and order and \\\"mob rule\\\"Trump pledged support for law enforcement around the country, saying the overwhelming majority of officers are noble and courageous but afraid to act. Trump repeated a theme from throughout the night that Democrat-run cities are violent and dangerous.  And similar to Vice President Mike Pence, Trump mentioned the protests in Kenosha, Wisconsin, without mentioning Jacob Blake, the Black man who was shot in the back by police and paralyzed, or the protesters who were shot and killed. \\\"When there is police misconduct, the justice system must hold wrongdoers fully and completely accountable, and it will.  But what we can never have in America -- and must never allow -- is mob rule.  In the strongest possible terms, the Republican Party condemns the rioting, looting, arson and violence we have seen in Democrat-run cities like Kenosha, Minneapolis, Portland, Chicago, and New York,\\\" he said. \\\"There is violence and danger in the streets of many Democrat-run cities throughout America.  This problem could easily be fixed if they wanted to.  We must always have law and order.  All federal crimes are being investigated, prosecuted and punished to the fullest extent of the law. \\\"Trump pledged to protect \\\"security, dignity, and peace. \\\"\\\"If the Democrat Party wants to stand with anarchists, agitators, rioters, looters, and flag-burners, that is up to them, but I, as your President, will not be a part of it.  The Republican Party will remain the voice of the patriotic heroes who keep America Safe. \\\"-- ABC News' Stephanie Ebbs 11:04 p. m.  Trump hits highlights of 2016 campaign promisesTrump hit on several policy areas that were a big feature of his 2016 campaign -- supporting American energy independence and withdrawing from the Paris climate agreement, standing up to China, renegotiating trade agreements with Canada and Mexico and harsher immigration policies, among others. And he used the issue of China to bring his remarks back to the pandemic, claiming wins on the U. S.  testing system, treatments like convalescent plasma that was recently granted emergency authorization by the FDA,  and a low fatality rate in the U. S. And he specifically pointed to Biden's approach to the pandemic response as worse for the country, saying it would have caused more deaths without the initial travel ban from China and causing families more harm if there were more shutdowns across the country. \\\"Instead of following the science, Joe Biden wants to inflict a painful shutdown on the entire country.  His shutdown would inflict unthinkable and lasting harm on our nation's children, families and citizens of all backgrounds,\\\" Trump said. \\\"The cost of the Biden shutdown would be measured in increased drug overdoses, depression, alcohol addiction, suicides, heart attacks, economic devastation and more.  Joe Biden's plan is not a solution to the virus, but rather a surrender. \\\"And Trump again brought up the efforts to make a vaccine available in \\\"record time\\\" with Operation Warp Speed, saying \\\"We will have a safe and effective vaccine this year, and together we will crush the virus. \\\"-- ABC News' Stephanie Ebbs10:54 p. m.  Trump calls Biden 'destroyer of American greatness'Trump portrayed Republicans and Democrats as opposed in their view of the \\\"American way of life,\\\" saying Democrats can't improve the country if they're intent on criticizing it.  He said this election is the most important in the history of the country. \\\"At no time before have voters faced a clearer choice between two parties, two visions, two philosophies or two agendas.  This election will decide whether we SAVE the American Dream, or whether we allow a socialist agenda to DEMOLISH our cherished destiny,\\\" he said. Trump called Joe Biden the \\\"destroyer of American greatness and that he voted against the best interest of blue collar workers while Trump has kept his campaign promises. \\\"At the Democrat National Convention, Joe Biden and his party repeatedly assailed America as a land of racial, economic and social injustice.  So tonight, I ask you a very simple question: How can the Democrat Party ask to lead our country when it spends so much time tearing down our country? \\\" Trump asked. \\\"In the left's backward view, they do not see America as the most free, just, and exceptional nation on earth.  Instead, they see a wicked nation that must be. \\\"-- ABC News' Stephanie Ebbs10:43 p. m.  Trump promises vaccine before the end of the yearIn addressing the ongoing coronavirus pandemic Trump said the country has been struck by a powerful and invisible enemy, but promised the country would meet the challenge and produce a vaccine before the end of the year. \\\"We are delivering lifesaving therapies, and will produce a vaccine BEFORE the end of the year, or maybe even sooner!  We will defeat the virus, end the pandemic and emerge stronger than ever before,\\\" he said. Public health experts have raised concerns about politicizing the process of approving and distributing a vaccine, saying any perception that the process was rushed to help Trump in the election could reduce trust and make people reluctant to take the vaccine, even though scientists involved in the process say it has been a completely scientific process. Experts like Dr.  Anthony Fauci have also said that it could take many months after a vaccine is produced before it is made available to most of the public. -- ABC News' Stephanie Ebbs10:41 p. m.  Trump to visit area impacted by Hurricane Laura President Trump says he plans to visit areas of Texas and Louisiana impacted by Hurricane Laura this weekend. \\\"Our thoughts are with the wonderful people who have just come through the wrath of Hurricane Laura.  We are working closely with state and local officials in Texas, Louisiana, Arkansas, Mississippi -- sparing no effort to save lives,\\\" he said at the beginning of his speech. \\\"While the hurricane was fierce, one of the strongest to make landfall in 150 years, the casualties and damage were far less than thought possible, only 24 hours ago.  And this is due to the great work of FEMA, law enforcement and the individual states.  I will be going this weekend.  And congratulations.  Thank you for that great job out there.  We really appreciate it. \\\"Earlier in the day during a visit to FEMA headquarters Trump said he considered delaying the speech until Monday to visit the area. -- ABC News' Stephanie Ebbs10:38 p. m.  Protesters outside White House chant 'vote him out'As the president delivers his acceptance speech at the White House, protesters nearby are chanting \\\"vote him out. \\\"Fences once again separate the people from The People's House. In a summer of unrest -- tense clashes between police and demonstrators have become a familiar sight. But Thursday night some protesters, like Ariana Evans, expressed their exhaustion. ABC News met the first-time demonstrator in May after the killing of George Floyd while in police custody.  On her megaphone, she would step in between violent clashes calling for demonstrations to be peaceful. She's protested every day since Floyd's death -- 94 days total. Now she's losing hope, no longer pushing for peace. \\\"They showed us that it doesn't matter how peaceful you are.  Doesn't matter if you comply.  Doesn't matter.  They will shoot you in the back in front of your kids. \\\"ABC News Senior congressional correspondent Mary Bruce reported hearing the faint music and pounding sounds from the protesters as the president speaks.  No specific chanting could be heard, she said, but an unmistakable din. -- ABC News' Rachel Scott10:31 p. m.  Trump accepts the nomination from the GOP\\\"I profoundly accept this nomination for President of the United States,\\\" Trump said shortly after beginning his remarks. 10:26 p. m.  'Washington has not changed Donald Trump.  Donald Trump has changed Washington:' Ivanka TrumpIvanka Trump made an impassioned pitch for her father's reelection, arguing that he will continue to stick with his ideas as the same candidate who won the election in 2016. She said he has \\\"strong convictions\\\" and makes his opinions known, even acknowledging that his communication style is \\\"not to everyone's taste\\\" and that his tweets can \\\"feel a bit unfiltered. \\\"\\\"But the results, the results speak for themselves.  He is so unapologetic about his beliefs that he has caused me and countless Americans to take a hard look at our own convictions and ask ourselves, what do we stand for?  What kind of America do we want to leave for our children?  I am more certain than ever before we want a future where our kids can believe in American greatness,\\\" she said. She then delivered a list of what she called the administration's successes, including the tax cut and reform bill, child care tax credits, reducing the cost of prescription drugs, and criminal justice reform where she said he was able to build bipartisan consensus -- the only mention of bipartisanship of the night. And she referred back to the 2016 campaign and the pitch that Trump is not a typical politician and will now repeat mistakes by past leaders. \\\"Four years ago, I told you I would fight alongside my father and, four years later, here I am.  Many of the issues my father has championed are not historically Republican priorities.  Yet, where Washington chooses sides, our president chooses common sense.  Where politicians choose party, our president chooses people,\\\" she said. \\\"For the first time in a long time we have a president who has called out Washington's hypocrisy, and they hate him for it,\\\" she added. \\\"Dad, people attack you for being unconventional.  But I love you for being real and I respect you for being effective.  Our president refuses to surrender his beliefs to score point with the political elite.  To my father, you are the elite.  You are the only people he cares about scoring points with.  If these problems were easy to solve, previous presidents would have done so.  But you don't achieve different results by doing things the same way. \\\"-- ABC News' Stephanie Ebbs 10:13 p. m.  Ivanka Trump introduces her father at the White HouseIvanka Trump is introducing her father to the audience at the White House. \\\"Tonight I stand before you as the proud daughter of the people's president,\\\" she said.  \\\"He is our commander-in-chief, champion of the American worker, defender of common sense and our voice for the forgotten men and women of this country. \\\"10:08 p. m.  Republican messages evoke images of violence, similar to 2016 campaignAnalysts at FiveThirtyEight note the parallels between the messages around violence in the RNC and the images of violence referenced by Trump during the 2016 campaign and his inaugural address. A recent Pew survey found that 59% of Americans say violent crime will be \\\"very important\\\" to their vote -- almost the same share as who cite the coronavirus outbreak.  So it might not be Americans' most important problem, but it does seem to be on people's radar. And FiveThirtyEight has reported that even crime has actually been on the decline over the last 30 years, even though many Americans believe it has gone up in part because of the rhetoric from politicians. Shootings and crime are up in New York City and other cities this year but overall crime is down, senior writer Amelia Thomson-DeVeaux notes, adding that it's too early to know if that's a long-term trend or an anomaly. And politics editor Sarah Frostenson notes the focus on crime in New York City and Mayor Bill de Blasio is part of a broader point to attack Democratic mayors, governors and politicians as ineffective. 10:07 p. m Muellers talk about death of their daughter, Trump's responseCarl and Marsha Mueller described the tragedy of the death of their daughter at the hands of the Islamic state and said they appreciated the president going after ISIS the way he did and the military service members who killed Abu Bakr al-Baghdad. \\\"Carl and I support Donald Trump because of his commitment to make and keep America great,\\\" said Marsha Mueller, \\\"with the passion of people like Kayla … Americans who don't just talk, they act.  That was our daughter, that's President Trump. \\\"10:04 p. m.  Multiple speakers highlight law enforcementMultiple speakers during the final night of the RNC highlighted President Trump's support for law enforcement and criminal justice reform, a contrast to the Democrats' focus on racial justice last week. Alice Johnson, a 63-year-old woman whose life sentence was commuted by Trump after advocacy from Kim Kardashian West, talked about his support for criminal justice reform through the First Step Act. \\\"When President Trump heard about me -- about the injustice of my story -- he saw me as a person.  He had compassion.  And he acted.  Free in body thanks to President Trump.  But free in mind thanks to the almighty God,\\\" Johnson said in her remarks. The RNC also featured an emotional story from Ann Dorn, whose husband David Dorn, a 77-year-old retired police officer, was killed attempting to stop looters from breaking into a pawn shop during protests in St.  Louis earlier this summer. \\\"I re-live that horror in my mind every single day.   My hope is that having you re-live it with me now will help shake this country from the nightmare we are witnessing in our cities and bring about positive, peaceful change,\\\" she said. Dorn went on to say that Trump support providing more resources to law enforcement. \\\"Violence and destruction are not legitimate forms of protest.  They do not safeguard Black lives.  They only destroy them.  President Trump understands this, (and) has offered federal help to restore order in our communities.  In a time when police departments are short on resources and manpower, we need that help,\\\" she said. Before Ann Dorn's speech was aired, her appearance and use of the officer's death as a way to praise Trump had already sparked outrage from David Dorn's children.  The officer's daughters, Debra White and Lisa Dorn, told the St.  Louis American on Wednesday that their father was a registered Democrat and didn't support Trump. White told the paper that her father opposed much of Trump's rhetoric and policies including \\\"the things he said about Colin Kaepernick, the kids locked up in cages, the racist remarks. \\\"Both daughters said they called Ann Dorn and asked her not to speak about their father at the convention. \\\"She can be a Trump supporter in her own right, but she should not politicize our father's death for Trump's agenda,\\\" Lisa Dorn said. And Pat Lynch, president of the Police Benevolent Association, said law enforcement is \\\"staring down the barrel\\\" of a public safety disaster and criticized Democrats for a lack of support. \\\"Unlike the Democrats, who froze in the face of rioting and looting, President Trump gives law enforcement the support and tools to put a stop to it -- period, end of story. \\\"-- ABC News' Terrence Smith and Ivan Pereira10:01 p. m.  Sen.  Tom Cotton references athletes who kneel during anthemA day after professional athletes and associations postponed games -- and some followed suit Thursday -- Sen.  Tom Cotton referenced an ongoing debate about players kneeling during the national anthem to call attention to the issues of racial inequality and police brutality. \\\"We need a president who stands up for America — not one who takes a knee,\\\" he said.  \\\"A strong and proud America is a safe America. \\\"9:54 p. m.  Giuliani warns Democrats will 'do to America' what they did in New YorkRudy Giuliani, former New York City mayor and personal attorney to the president, asked viewers not to let \\\"Democrats do to America what they have done to New York. \\\"\\\"These continuous riots in Democratic cities give you a good view of the future under Biden,\\\" he said.  \\\"It is clear that a vote for Biden and the Democrats creates the risk that you will bring this lawlessness to your city. \\\"9:49 p. m.  Ben Carson defends Trump on issues of raceHousing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson, the highest ranking African American in the Trump administration, defended the president from accusations that his comments and policies are racist. Carson said Trump's policies support economic success for everyone, citing his policies on criminal justice reform, funding for historically black colleges and universities, school choice and programs to bring investment to disadvantaged areas. \\\"President Trump does not dabble in identity politics.  He wants everyone to succeed and believes in the adage \\\"a rising tide lifts all boats. \\\" Many on the other side love to incite division by claiming that president trump is a racist.  They could not be more wrong,\\\" he said. 9:45 p. m.  Wisconsin politicians react to Trump's expected comments on Jacob Blake protestsThere are very different reactions from political party leaders on the ground in Wisconsin to the news that Trump is expected to address the police shooting and protests in Kenosha. Wisconsin Republican Chair Andrew Hitt welcomed Trump's comments, saying federal presence has already been helpful to \\\"bring order to the chaos. \\\"There have been more than 200 agents and marshals from the FBI, ATF and USMS who have been deployed to Kenosha. \\\"The inaction of our Democratic governor and attorney general led to Wisconsinites waking up to images of Kenosha burning multiple times this week.  President Trump stepped in to help bring order to the chaos and Wisconsinites are grateful,\\\" said Hitt, who will be at the White House the president's acceptance speech. Democrats denounced the reaction from Trump, noting that Pence will no longer be speaking at a Wisconsin college commencement and saying Trump's words will only bring more division. \\\"Under Trump and Pence's failed leadership, our country is in the midst of three national crises: the economic recession, a global pandemic, and a social justice crisis that is disproportionately impacting communities of color.  His administration has done nothing but sow hate and division, and there is an absolute void of leadership at a time when Wisconsinites need it the most.  As the state works to heal, it's clear why Pence was dis-invited from speaking at Wisconsin Lutheran College's commencement: the Trump administration is focused on dividing, not uniting,\\\" said Chris Walton, chair of the Milwaukee Dems. -- ABC News' Cheyenne Haslett9:32 p. m.  Ben Carson addresses Blake familyIn the first reference to Jacob Blake on Thursday -- and the second during the entire RNC -- Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson said \\\"our hearts go out the Blake family. \\\"\\\"As Jacob's mother has urged the country, let's use our hearts, our love and our intelligence to work together to show the rest of the world how humans are supposed to treat each other. \\\"9:28 p. m.  Claims of Trump's economic wins lack contextMultiple speakers Thursday night praised President Trump for the growth of the U. S.  economy and said it was important he stay in office to keep the economy successful. Dan Scavino, White House deputy chief of staff for communications and director of social media, said, \\\"Just think about what we achieved together with President Trump.  The strongest economy in history.  The lowest unemployment rate for almost all demographic groups -- Black Americans, Hispanic Americans, women, and so many more. \\\"But the strong performance of the economy under Trump before the coronavirus, was -- by many metrics -- a continuation of growth that began under President Barack Obama. Pre-pandemic declines in unemployment that led to record-low levels of African American and Hispanic unemployment under Trump began during the Obama administration. The same goes for the women's unemployment rate -- which reached a 10-year low under Obama, before dropping under Trump. The U. S.  economy gained about 6. 6 million jobs in Trump's first 36 months in office, after roughly 8. 1 million jobs in Obama's last 36 months. In January 2017, Trump took office after 75 straight months of jobs growth. Trump has touted the millions of jobs created since the economy began reopening -- including 2. 5 million in May, 4. 8 million in June, and 1. 8 million in July -- but the economy, in the midst of the worst crisis since the Great Depression, still has roughly 13 million fewer jobs than it did in February. After years of steady quarterly GDP growth since the Great Recession, the government reported a 9. 5% decline in goods and services produced in the second quarter of 2020 -- wiping out nearly five years of growth. Federal relief efforts have also blunted the impact of the coronavirus on the economy -- though negotiations between Democrats and the White House to extend expired small business and unemployment benefits have stalled for weeks. More than one million Americans filed for unemployment this week, according to the Labor Department.  The weekly claims figure has been north of one million nearly every week since March -- raising questions about a \\\"V-shaped\\\" recovery predicted by the White House. -- ABC News' Benjamin Siegel 9:14 p. m.  Trump to deliver 'tough' speech blasting Biden's record, campaign aides say Trump is set to deliver a blistering speech to accept his nomination, targeting Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden on a slew of topics including borders, taxes, energy policy, trade, China and crime, according to Trump campaign aides. The president is expected to blast Biden with familiar lines of attacks including hammering his decades long career in Washington and reiterating his claim that Democrats' agenda is \\\"the most extreme set of proposals ever put forward by a major party nominee,\\\" according to excerpts from Trump's RNC acceptance speech. Trump will lay out \\\"two distinct visions: the president's vision against Joe Biden's vision,\\\" Trump campaign communications director Tim Murtaugh said, while detailing the \\\"unvarnished Joe Biden record and the unvarnished Joe Biden agenda\\\" and not the \\\"cleansed scrubbed version that we saw during the Democratic National Convention. \\\"The president will also place a strong emphasis on \\\"jobs and economic recovery and economic excellence\\\" while claiming Biden's record is one that had \\\"raised taxes will raise taxes again. \\\"Biden told ABC \\\"World News Tonight\\\" anchor David Muir in an interview which aired Sunday that his administration would impose \\\"no new taxes\\\" to households making under $400,000 a year. Trump will also mention Hurricane Laura and \\\"ask for God's blessing\\\" for those in its path and mention the unrest in American cities, the campaign said.  -- ABC News' Will Steakin and Terrance Smith 9:09 p. m.  McConnell: Considers it his 'responsibility to look out for Middle America'Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said he considers it his \\\"responsibility to look out for Middle America. \\\"\\\"I'm immensely proud of the work the Republican Senate has done.  We are the firewall against Nancy Pelosi's agenda. \\\"9:05 p. m.  Rep.  Jeff Van Drew: 'The party had moved from liberal to radical'Rep.  Jeff Van Drew, who left the Democratic Party to become a Republican slammed House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and members of the so-called \\\"Squad. \\\"\\\"I was already uncomfortable with a San Francisco liberal running the House,\\\" he said adding that now \\\"the party had moved from liberal to radical. \\\"\\\"Joe Biden is being told what to do by the radicals running my former party, the same radicals trying to install him as their puppet president,\\\" he continued. 8:58 p. m.  RNC alludes to protests against police violence, without mentioning victims by nameAccording to the ABC News' Political Unit's count Jacob Blake's name has been mentioned one time during the Republican National Convention -- during the opening prayer on Tuesday night. Blake is a 29-year-old black man who police in Kenosha, Wisconsin, shot seven times in the back on Sunday, leading to several days of protests calling to end police violence against people of color. On the second night of the convention Norma Urrabazo, pastor of the International Church of Las Vegas, called for healing to Blake and his family and community. \\\"Lord, we come before you to ask for your spirit of peace to come over hurting communities in Wisconsin tonight.  We pray for healing and comfort to Jacob Blake and his family.  We pray for your protection over those who put their lives in harm's way to bring safety and security to our streets,\\\" Urrabazo said in the opening prayer. Vice President Mike Pence alluded to protests around Blake's shooting and George Floyd's death without mentioning them by name in his acceptance speech on Wednesday night, saying \\\"We will have law and order on the streets of this country for every American of every race and creed and color. \\\"\\\"The American people know we don't have to choose between supporting law enforcement and standing with our African-American neighbors to improve the quality of their lives, education, jobs, and safety,\\\" Pence said. \\\"And from the first days of this administration, we've done both.  And we will keep supporting law enforcement and keep supporting our African-American and minority communities across this land for four more years. \\\"RNC Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel told ABC News' Powerhouse Politics podcast that speakers can and should mention Blake, noting that the president has reached out to the family and that a lot of the remarks were pretaped. -- ABC News' Alisa Wiersema 8:49 p. m.  McCarthy on how Trump worked with CongressHouse Minority Leader Rep.  Kevin McCarthy highlighted the ways in which he said the president has worked with Congress during his term in office. \\\"Four years ago President Trump promised to be your voice.  He kept that promise, but there's still so much more to do.  The choice before you cannot be clearer: forward in freedom or backward in socialism. \\\"8:45 p. m.  Protesters gather near White House ahead of Trump's acceptance speechProtesters have been gathering at Black Lives Matter plaza near the White House ahead of the president's acceptance speech later tonight. \\\"The president has a history of being silent when it comes to the shooting and the killing of Black Americans,\\\" ABC News White House correspondent Rachel Scott said on ABC News Live, \\\"and it's that silence and the lack of action that promotes the outrage that you are seeing. \\\"8:34 p. m.  Jonathan Karl on the convention event at the White HouseOn ABC News Live, Chief White House Correspondent Jonathan Karl said the set up for a convention event left him, \\\"practically speechless, here.  I have been covering the White House on and off for two decades.  … Here we have the entire South Lawn of the White House transformed into the hall, the venue, for a national political convention. \\\"8:23 p. m.  DNC to air ad slamming Trump's leadership during Republican National ConventionThe Democratic National Committee plans to counter Trump's acceptance speech with an ad casting Trump as a failed leader by using his own words during the 2016 convention.  It will be overlaid with footage from events during his first term in office, including video from the white supremacist rally that took place in Charlottesville, Virginia, in August 2017. \\\"Donald Trump's chaotic leadership and divisive rhetoric has been a disaster for Americans.  His failures have led to over 180,000 deaths, left millions unemployed and decimated our economy,\\\" said DNC War Room senior spokesperson Lily Adams.  \\\"During his 2016 convention, Trump himself spoke against the same sort of chaos he has caused in our country.  It's clear to Americans that we can't afford four more years of Trump. \\\"The minute-long ad will air on television in Washington and is part of a six-figure ad buy over the week. It starts with the president at the 2016 convention saying, \\\"The most basic duty of government is to defend the lives of its own citizens, any government that fails to do so is unworthy to lead. \\\"Democrats have tried to counter-program the Republicans' convention in some way every night. -- ABC News' Quinn Scanlan8:18 p. m.  COVID-19 protocol for the Trump's White House remarks: Document ABC News obtained a document from a RNC source that was sent to some guests invited to the evening's celebration at the White House.  It included details on the coronavirus protocols in place -- or lack thereof. The document made no mention of COVID-19 tests.  Instead, it asks guests to stay home if they aren't feeling well, experiencing symptoms, have recently tested positive for the virus or have recently been in close contact with someone who has. It says masks are only required at arrival and in security screening areas and encouraged in \\\"high-traffic areas including restrooms and hospitality spaces. \\\" It also says to \\\"practice social distancing whenever possible. \\\"Upwards of 1,500 people are expected to attend Trump's speech, sources tell ABC News, and photos show chairs placed on the South Lawn without six-feet of distance recommended by the CDC. Separately, the Trump campaign sent a statement to the print pool reporter in response to a request for details about COVID-19 protocols, screening, testing and masks. The statement -- from an executive at the company the RNC is working with, Patronus Medical -- says that \\\"strict protocols are in full compliance with multiple guidelines set forth by the United States Centers for Disease Control, the District of Columbia Department of Public Health, and other leading authorities on health safety. \\\"No other details were provided.  -- ABC News' Rachel Scott and Ben Gittleson  8:12 p. m.  Harris slams Trump on coronavirus, calls Blake shooting 'sickening,' in counter programming event In her first solo event as the Democratic vice presidential nominee, Sen.  Kamala Harris delivered a preemptive strike on Republicans Thursday in wide-ranging remarks ahead of the convention -- slamming Trump's response to Americans suffering amid systematic racism and the coronavirus pandemic. \\\"The Republican convention is designed for one purpose: to soothe Donald Trump's ego.  To make him feel good.  Well here's the thing -- he's the president of the United States.  And it's not supposed to be about him.  It's supposed to be about the health and the safety and the wellbeing of the American people,\\\" Harris said from George Washington University's campus. Harris directly addressed the shooting of Jacob Black, something the president has not yet done publicly. \\\"As Vice President Biden put it, the shots fired at Mr.  Blake pierced the soul of our nation.  It's sickening to watch.  It's all too familiar.  And it must end,\\\" she said. On the pandemic front, Harris said Trump got it \\\"wrong from the beginning\\\" and \\\"was fixated on the stock market over fixing the problem. \\\"\\\"Here's what you have to understand about the nature of a pandemic.  It's relentless.  You can't stop it with a tweet,\\\" she said. It was the biggest counter programming event for Democrats this week. -- ABC News' Averi Harper 8:04 p. m.  McConnell targets 'middle America,' calls Republican Senate a 'firewall' against Democrats Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell used his home state of Kentucky to appeal to \\\"middle America,\\\" calling himself the only leader in Washington not from New York or California. Trump is from New York and all 50 states, Puerto Rico and the U. S.  Virgin Islands, are represented in Congress. \\\"Today's Democrat party doesn't want to improve life for middle America.  They prefer that all of us in flyover country keep quiet and let them decide how we should live our lives,\\\" McConnell said, going on to list Democratic priorities he said would tell Americans what to do, including when to resume activities like work and school during the coronavirus pandemic. McConnell specifically called out Democratic support for making the District of Columbia a state, saying, \\\"With two more liberal senators, we cannot undo the damage they've done. \\\"\\\"I am immensely proud of the work the Republican Senate has done.  We are the firewall against Nancy Pelosi's agenda,\\\" he said. -- ABC News' Kendall Karson 7:45 p. m.  Trump to address Kenosha 'unrest' in RNC acceptance speech, unclear if he'll mention Jacob Blake by name After days of public silence on the shooting of Jacob Blake in Kenosha, Wisconsin, it remains unclear whether Trump will directly address the shooting in his nomination acceptance speech. During an interview Thursday morning, Trump campaign communications director Tim Murtaugh strongly suggested the president would directly address the latest incident involving police treatment of an unarmed black man -- before later appearing to walk back his comments. \\\"I think he will,\\\" Tim Murtaugh said, when asked on CNN if the president would speak directly about the Blake shooting in his address.  \\\"He'll talk about what happened in Wisconsin and I think he'll broaden it and talk with what we've seen in cities and states all around the country in the last couple of months. \\\"Later, when asked whether Trump would specifically mention Blake, Murtaugh declined to elaborate. \\\"I'm not going to get into very much in the way of specifics about what the president will talk about as far as specific topics, but the president will address the unrest in this country.  He will make reference to Kenosha, and he will speak about the issue,\\\" he told ABC News.  -- ABC News' Jordyn Phelps and Will Steakin  7:34 p. m.  DHS employees receive Hatch Act warning after acting secretary's RNC appearance, ahead of White House speech An internal message sent out to all Department of Homeland Security employees Thursday, which was reviewed by ABC News, reminded them to not engage in \\\"partisan political activity\\\" after acting Secretary Chad Wolf participated in a naturalization ceremony earlier this week that was made part of the RNC's prime time programming -- a potential violation of the Hatch Act. \\\"We, as a department, are under heightened scrutiny during the presidential election cycle,\\\" the email said.  \\\"It is important that we, DHS employees, are familiar with the policies surrounding partisan political activity to make sure we comply with them. \\\"The message comes as House Democrats have launched an investigation into Secretary of Mike Pompeo's participation in the RNC while overseas on an official state trip.  -- ABC News' Luke Barr 7:24 p. m.  ABC News' 2020 interactive election mapWho will win in November?  See how the Electoral College could play out with ABC News' 2020 interactive election map: 7:17 p. m.  RNC chair said she hopes Blake's name will be mentioned in final night's program RNC Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel told ABC News' \\\"Powerhouse Politics\\\" podcast Thursday that she hoped Blake's name comes up in convention speeches Thursday night, but she didn't single out Trump's speech. \\\"Of course, we can make mention of Jacob Blake's name and the president has reached out to the family,\\\" McDaniel told ABC News Political Director Rick Klein and Chief White House Correspondent Jonathan Karl. She said the virtual nature of the speeches, prompted by the coronavirus pandemic, meant some speeches were taped before Blake was in the news. \\\"I hope that they do tonight.  I think a lot of it has been pre-taped . . .  because of the virtual nature of many of the speeches, that wasn't in the news at the time that some of those speeches were taped.  I'm saying right now as party chair we want to see this investigated; we want to see this seen through,\\\" she said on Blake's shooting.  -- ABC News' Terrance Smith 7 p. m.  Thursday night's extended speaker lineup The Trump campaign released a list of speakers for the final night of the convention. 7 p. m.  Speaker overviewSenior adviser Ivanka Trump will introduce her father on the final night of what's become a norms-busting political convention, which has showcased the pageantry of the presidency in unprecedented ways and transformed the White House into a backdrop for Trump's campaign -- despite some of the proceedings appearing to violate ethics laws. Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy of California, Arkansas Sen.  Tom Cotton and the president's personal attorney and former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani are also expected to speak Thursday. In addition, convention watchers will hear from the parents of humanitarian aid worker Kayla Mueller, who was killed by the Islamic State while a hostage, and Alice Johnson, a woman who was serving a life sentence in federal prison until Trump commuted her sentence -- an effort in part pushed by Kim Kardashian West. Trump and Vice President Mike Pence will face Democratic nominees Joe Biden and Kamala Harris in the general election on Nov.  3, though some Americans are expecting to receive their ballots as early as next week.

US now has more than 105,000 cases of coronavirusThe amount of novel coronavirus cases around the world and in the U. S.  continues to skyrocket.  By Saturday night, the number of diagnosed COVID-19 cases around the world surpassed 664,000. It was just Thursday that the globe reached 500,000 cases, which was double the number of coronavirus cases from the week before. The U. S.  surpassed 124,000 diagnosed coronavirus cases Saturday, according to data compiled by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering at Johns Hopkins University.  There are at least 2,190 deaths in the country. At least 140,000 people have recovered from the virus during this pandemic. Tune into ABC at 1 p. m.  ET and ABC News Live at 4 p. m.  ET every weekday for special coverage of the novel coronavirus with the full ABC News team, including the latest news, context and analysis. Today's biggest developments:Here's how the news developed Saturday.  All times Eastern. After initially being restricted from passing through the Panama Canal, the country has changed its tune and the cruise ship MS Zaandam will be allowed through. There are more than 130 people on the ship suffering from \\\"flu-like symptoms,\\\" as well as two people who have tested positive for COVID-19 and four elderly passengers who have died. The MS Rotterdam, owned by Holland America, like the Zaandam, was also waiting to transit the canal. \\\"We are aware of reported permission for both Zaandam and Rotterdam to transit the Panama Canal in the near future,\\\" Holland American said in a statement at 11 p. m.  Eastern time.  \\\"We greatly appreciate this consideration in the humanitarian interest of our guests and crew.  This remains a dynamic situation, and we continue to work with the Panamanian authorities to finalize details. \\\"An inmate has died from COVID-19 at FCI Oakdale in Oakdale, Louisiana, two sources told ABC News. This is the first known death inside the Bureau of Prisons. Patrick Jones, 49, was sentenced to 324 months in prison for or possession of 425 grams of crack cocaine with intent to sell within 1,000 feet of a junior college, the BOP said in a press release. Jones was the first inmate inside the BOP to test positive on March 19.  He was placed on a ventilator one day later and he died Saturday. Officials said he had preexisting conditions that contributed to his death. Madison Square Garden Company CEO James Dolan has tested positive for coronavirus, according to a spokesperson. Dolan, 64, took over as CEO of Cablevision, the powerhouse cable company, from his father, Charles, but is most known in New York City for being owner of the NBA's New York Knicks and NHL's New York Rangers. As chairman of The Madison Square Garden Company, he oversees those teams as well as television station MSG Network and owns the world famous Madison Square Garden in Manhattan. Cablevision was sold in 2016 upon which time he left as CEO. Sophie Grégoire Trudeau, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's wife, has been given a clean bill of health after previously testing positive for coronavirus. She said in a Facebook post Saturday night that she was cleared by her doctor and Ottawa Public Health. From the bottom of my heart, I want to say thank you to everyone who reached out to me with their well wishes.  And to everyone who is suffering right now, I send you all my love. \\\"These are challenging times,\\\" she wrote.  \\\"I know it’s not easy to be alone -- we are all social beings, me included!  But just because we’re increasing the physical distance between us doesn’t mean we have to do the same emotionally.  From social media to a simple phone call, there are so many ways for us to stay connected while we’re apart and actually deepen our relationships. \\\"Sophie tested positive for the virus March 13.  Her husband said he never developed symptoms and continued working. Maryland Gov.  Larry Hogan announced tonight that a nursing facility in Mt.  Airy, Maryland, was hit by an outbreak of COVID-19. A total of 66 residents have tested positive at the facility, with 11 currently hospitalized. After threatening it earlier in the day, President Donald Trump now says he will not be using an enforceable quarantine in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut. Instead Trump said he has asked the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to issue a strong travel advisory \\\"to be administered by the Governors, in consultation with the Federal Government. \\\"The CDC later issued its advisory, writing in a release, \\\"Due to extensive community transmission of COVID -19 in the area, CDC urges residents of New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut to refrain from non-essential domestic travel for 14 days effective immediately.  This Domestic Travel Advisory does not apply to employees of critical infrastructure industries, including but not limited to trucking, public health professionals, financial services, and food supply. \\\"The statement also said the governors of Connecticut, New York and New Jersey would have full oversight of implementing the advisory. The governors of each of the three states -- all Democrats -- had reacted strongly against the proposed measure. \\\"That is not a quarantine, that is a lockdown,\\\" New York Gov.  Andrew Cuomo said in an interview on CNN, likening the restriction to Wuhan, China.  \\\"I don’t believe it would be legal.  I believe it would be illegal. \\\"The death toll from novel coronavirus passed 2,000 in the United States on Saturday evening. The number has increased dramatically in recent days, with the toll crossing 1,000 just Wednesday. There are now more than 30,000 deaths worldwide -- about one-third in Italy. New York Presbyterian's hospital network will comply with Gov.  Andrew Cuomo's executive order requiring one partner be allowed in delivery rooms during childbirth. Previously, the hospital network had said no partners would be allowed in the delivery room to combat the pandemic. Cuomo's order applies to all hospitals in the state, both public and private. Mount Sinai, which instituted a similar obstetrics ban, also will comply with the order. Melissa DeRosa, secretary to Cuomo, announced the executive order would be issued on Saturday. An infant was among the 13 new deaths reported in Illinois, the state's Department of Public Health reported. \\\"If you haven't been paying attention, this is your wake-up call,\\\" Dr.  Ngozi Ezike, the director of the state's health agency, said.  \\\"We don't want to be one of the hotspots that the Surgeon General predicts Chicago could be. ”No details around the infant's death were provided. Ezike said a full investigation was underway to determine the cause of death. “There has never before been a death associated with COVID-19 in an infant. The Department of Public Health noted that while older adults are at higher risk of severe illness, and more than 85% of deaths in Illinois are among individuals 60 years of age and older, people of all ages are suffering severe illness. There were also an additional 465 new cases in Illinois, where there is a total of 3,491 confirmed cases. The global death toll has reached at least 30,249, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. Italy has the highest number of reported deaths, at more than 10,000, followed by Spain at more than 5,800. President Donald Trump said he had compelled General Motors to manufacture ventilators, after saying the day before that \\\"maybe we won't even need the full activation,\\\" referring to using the Defense Protection Act. \\\"This week, I invoked the Defense Production Act to compel General Motors to carry out federal contracts for ventilators and I think they're going to do a great job.  I have to say that,\\\" Trump said in his speech at Norfolk Naval Base. The president also said that FEMA has \\\"shipped or delivered\\\" 11. 6 million N-95 respirators, 26 million surgical masks and 5. 2 million face shields. The number of confirmed cases in Italy continue to slow, with 5,933 new cases reported Saturday -- a 6. 8% increase in total new cases, down from Friday's 7. 3%. It was the lowest percentage increase to date in the country.  The total number of cases in Italy is now at least 92,472, health officials said. In the province of Bergamo, the hardest-hit province, there was a nearly 50% drop in new reported cases, from Friday's 602 to Saturday's 289. However, the number of new deaths in the last 24 hours hit 889, bringing the total death toll to 10,023. The United Nations will donate 250,000 protective face masks to New York City, an area now considered the epicenter of the pandemic. UN Secretary General António Guterres said the masks would go to medical professionals in the city who have been \\\"working courageously, selflessly, and tirelessly in response to the spread of COVID-19 across the boroughs in the hope that they play some small role in saving lives. \\\"The U. N.  and U. S.  Mission personnel are working with Mayor Bill de Blasio's office to quickly get the masks to medical facilities in New York City. The Vatican press office confirmed Saturday that the Pope has been tested and neither he nor his closest aides have resulted positive. President Donald Trump said he may announce an enforceable quarantine in the New York, New Jersey and Connecticut areas. Trump noted that he \\\"doesn't want to do it, but may have to. \\\"“There's a possibility that sometime today we'll do a quarantine, short-term two weeks, on New York, probably New Jersey, certain parts of Connecticut,” Trump told reporters on the South Lawn. The president said that he would restrict travel from those areas because \\\"they're having problems down in Florida, a lot of New Yorkers going down, we don't want that. \\\" He later said such a quarantine would not apply to truckers from outside of New York who are making deliveries or traveling through the state. \\\"It won't affect trade in anyway,\\\" Trump said. New York Gov.  Andrew Cuomo later responded to the possibility, saying he had not spoken to the president about such a measure and did not know what it would mean. Connecticut Gov.  Ned Lamont also issued a statement, saying, \\\"Our state has already called on residents to stay at home.  Further, if interstate travel is absolutely necessary, our state has directed travelers to self-quarantine to prevent against further transmission of the virus. \\\" Lamont said that he looked forward to speaking to the president directly, \\\"because confusion leads to panic. \\\"There are now 52,318 confirmed cases in New York, after 7,681 new cases were reported in the last 24 hours, Gov.  Andrew Cuomo said in a press conference. The deaths in the state were up to 728 from 519. Cuomo did say there was a bit of good news: new hospitalizations and new ICU admissions went down in the last 24-hour period.  He cautioned that one day does not prove a trend and the situation certainly could go the other way. There were 372 people admitted in to an ICU Friday and 172 admitted Saturday.  For new hospitalizations, the number Friday was 1,154 and 847 for Saturday. “The overall line is still up,” Cuomo said.  “This is good news on a one day number. ”The governor also announced he was postponing the presidential primary in the state from April 28 to June 23, the date of the state's down ballot primary elections. President Donald Trump declared a major disaster in Massachusetts and Michigan, ordering federal assistance to the states. Federal funding will now be available for crisis counseling for those affected in both states. A New York Police Department detective has become the department's first uniformed officer to die after contracting coronavirus, police sources told ABC News. Detective Cedric Dixon was the officer who died.  He was the third member of the department to die after contracting the virus, following a janitor and an administrative aid. “We are hurting, we are crying and we continue to fight,” Police Commissioner Dermot Shea said Saturday afternoon. Dixon was 48.  According to police sources, he had underlying conditions. The SeaWorld theme parks will remain temporarily closed, according to a statement from the company.  The park had originally planned to open at the end of March. Animal care experts will still be onsite to care for the animals.  \\\"During this time, our animal care experts will continue to look after the health and welfare needs of the animals in our care,\\\" a statement from SeaWord read. \\\"We look forward to welcoming our valued guests back to our parks soon,\\\" the statement continued. Nearly 200 cities in the United States do not have an adequate supply of tests kits or face masks for medical personnel and first responders, including police, fire, and EMTs, according to a report from the U. S.  Conference of Mayors. About 88% of cities of the cities surveyed, or 186 cities, don't have enough personal protective equipment (PPE) other than face masks to protect the front-line workers, according to the report. The staggering statistics \\\"illustrates the scope and severity of the need for COVID-19 emergency equipment in this nation's cities,\\\" according to a letter from the conference's executive director, Tom Cochran. One-hundred and thirty-one states have reported receiving no emergency equipment from their states, while 84% of those who are receiving help say it is not adequate for their needs. The report estimates that across the cities surveyed there is a need for 28. 5 million face masks, 24. 4 million PPE items, 7. 9 million test kits, and 139,000 ventilators. There were 213 cities in 40 states that participated in the survey. \\\"It is abundantly clear that the shortage of essential items such as face masks, test kits, personal protective equipment, ventilators and other items needed by health and safety personnel has reached crisis proportions in cities across the country,\\\" Cochran said in his letter. Spain reported 8,189 new cases of novel coronavirus in the last 24 hours, putting the total number of cases at 72,248, according to the Health Ministry. There have now been 5,690 deaths after 832 new deaths occurred.  More than 4,500 still remain in intensive care. The German Aerospace Center will make medical equipment using its 3D printers, according to a statement from the agency. The printers were tested and can successfully produce protective masks and valves for respirators, the statement read. The German Aerospace Center had been asked by the European Commission to help in producing much needed medical equipment as the world scrambles to combat the pandemic. The most powerful printer can produce up to 10 protective masks or 15 valves for ventilators per day, according to the agency.  However, it's possible to increase the quantity through networking with other institutes and facilities. Air pollution has dropped significantly across Europe as lockdowns have been adopted and residents are told to stay home, according to the European Space Agency. Satellite images from the Copernicus Sentinel-5P show the drop in nitrogen dioxide concentrations, which coincides with the quarantine measures, according to the agency. The most significant drops were in Milan, Paris and Madrid. Scientists from the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute (KNMI) have been using data from the satellite to monitor both weather and pollution over Europe.  The images show the nitrogen dioxide concentrations from March 14 to March 25, comparing it to the averages from last year. \\\"By combining data for a specific period of time, 10 days in this case, the meteorological variability partly averages out and we begin to see the impact of changes due to human activity,\\\" Henk Eskes, from KNMI, said in a statement. Other countries are also being monitored, including the Netherlands and the United Kingdom.  Scientists have said that right now there is a larger variability because of changing weather conditions, making it more difficult to observe any changes. A day after announcing all vehicles with New York license plates will be pulled over by state police and travelers informed they must quarantine if they are staying in the state, Rhode Island Gov.  Gina Raimondo announced that the National Guard would go door-to-door to make sure New Yorkers are following orders. \\\"We have a pinpointed a risk that we need to address, and that risk is New York City,\\\" Raimondo said Friday during her daily coronavirus media briefing.  She said the 14-day quarantine for New York travelers is a law and will be enforced, \\\"it's not a suggestion. \\\"Members of the National Guard will be stationed at bus and train stops, as well as airports to collect personal information form travelers when they arrive.  State police officers are doing the same for vehicles they pull over.  With that information, Raimondo said authorities would go hotels, vacation homes and any type of residence to keep track of New York travelers. All these measures, she said, are designed to let the state have time to get ready for the spread of COVID-19.  If Rhode Island were to have an outbreak right now, she said the state and its healthcare system would be overwhelmed. \\\"We are not ready for a surge of cases,\\\" Raimondo said. New York City currently has at least 26,000 diagnosed cases of COVID-19, with 450 deaths.  There are more than 44,000 cases in New York state.  As of Friday, only 28 of the 203 diagnosed coronavirus cases in Rhode Island have required hospitalization.  The state has no reported COVID-19 deaths.

View more opinion at CNN.  \\n    \\n  President Trump’s former personal lawyer Michael Cohen made a series of shocking allegations about the commander in chief Wednesday. \\n\\n  As the President spent his day overseas trying to reach a historic deal with the North Koreans, Cohen painted a portrait of a leader who has engaged in all sorts of fraud, broke campaign finance laws, associated with devious figures, knew of the dirty and possibly illegal tricks being done by some members of his campaign and who instructed associates like Cohen to intimidate people who were perceived as a threat. \\n\\n  As if that was not enough, Cohen alleged that the President is a racist.  (All of these allegations have been denied by the White House or by the President’s GOP defenders. ) \\n\\n  But will the hearings change public opinion?  \\n\\n  The Republicans on the Oversight Committee gave a pretty good indication of why President Trump’s base is unlikely to move even a little.  They essentially are in tune with Trump’s statement from 2016: “I could stand in the middle of 5th Avenue and shoot somebody and I wouldn’t lose voters. ”\\n\\n  Throughout their questioning of Cohen, the Republicans showed absolutely no interest in probing the issues that were raised about the President.  \\n\\nI was one of the 500 people Michael Cohen threatened\\n\\n  They spent the entire time  attacking Cohen’s behavior and making insinuations about the Democratic-led hearings themselves.  Republicans took every opportunity to remind the public that Cohen is on his way to prison, in part for lying to Congress.  They used Cohen’s lawyer and former Clinton associate, Lanny Davis, and suggestions about mysterious forces funding him, as the bogeyman to allege that Cohen’s testimony was politically motivated.  \\n\\n  The actual substance of the charges, which have not only been raised by Cohen but have come from multiple investigations, were of no interest.  Republicans didn’t want to listen to his answers and used this opportunity to grandstand for their voters.  Their performance reveals how many of Trump’s most loyal Republicans will certainly act.  \\n\\n  But that does not mean that portions of the Republican Party outside the base can’t be moved by congressional hearings.  After all, what motivates their ongoing support for President Trump is much more about partisan interests than loyalty.  This means he is not invulnerable.  It would be possible to turn segments of the party against him if he has taken actions that they feel are too risky.  \\n\\nMichael Cohen is making history\\n\\n  The first tangible evidence that defections are possible since the passage of the Russians sanctions legislation in 2017, were the 13 Republicans who voted with House Democrats to pass a resolution seeking to revoke his emergency power to build a wall.  \\n\\n  It was also clear to President Trump during the final days of the shutdown that his time for that battle was over: either he agreed to pass a budget resolution or the Republicans would move forward without him.  With the midterms only a few months behind them and polls showing that Trump is struggling in the battleground states which were key to his victory, such as Wisconsin and Michigan, Republicans are justifiably worried.  \\n\\n  These signs of defection are certainly far from any indication that he is at any risk with his own party. \\n\\nWhy did Trump need to employ a professional liar? \\n\\n  But it would be a mistake to discount the potential for full-blown hearings to change the dynamics within the Republican Party and to further damage Trump’s standing with independent voters.  The testimony of Michael Cohen alone won’t do the trick.  He is a severely flawed witness given his record, and his words alone cannot paint a damning picture of the administration to Republicans who remain focused on victory in 2020.  \\n\\n  Committee Republicans demonstrated that they have no interest in listening.  The conservative media, which didn’t exist when Richard Nixon was president, will be spinning the day’s events a million different ways, in Trump’s favor.  \\n\\n  However, robust hearings can matter.  Seeing and hearing the major players in a scandal is much different than reading about them or seeing a prosecutorial report.  \\n\\n  The gold standard remains the Watergate committee that did have the effect, over a period of many weeks and with numerous witnesses, to break down the Republican support that President Nixon continued to count on until the very end.  The congressional hearings and investigations were successful in that they helped legislators in both parties gain a fuller picture of what the Nixon White House was about and to put the original sin, the break-in of the Democratic National Committee headquarters, into a larger context.  \\n\\n  Some of the outcome in 2019 will depend on the Democrats and how far they are willing to go to ensure accountability and pursue a full-blown investigation, even at the risk of political backlash.  \\n© 2021 Cable News Network.

The ministry of corporate affairs (MCA) has already notified the two amendments in the CSR rules on Monday that would allow companies to spend their CSR funds in R&D activities related to new vaccine, drugs and medical devices in three financial years starting from 2020-21. The Companies Act requires firms with a net worth of Rs 500 crore or more, or turnover of Rs 1,000 crore or more, or net profit of Rs 5 crore or more in the immediately preceding financial year, to mandatorily spend 2% of average net profit of the preceding three years on CSR.  Money earmarked for spending on CSR activities in a year is about Rs 15,000 crore. MCA has amended the Schedule VII to include R&D for development of drugs to cure Covid-19 as one of the approved CSR activities, a second official said.  The government has specified broad areas of mandatory CSR spending in Schedule VII. Accordingly, contributions to R&D projects in the field of science, technology, engineering and medicine, funded by the central or state governments or any public sector entity would also be counted under CSR, he added.  Companies can now contribute their CSR funds to public funded universities, Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs), Department of Atomic Energy (DAE), Department of Biotechnology (DBT), Department of Science and Technology (DST) and Department of Pharmaceuticals, he said.  They can also participate in institutions under the ministry of ayurveda, yoga and naturopathy, unani, siddha and homoeopathy (AYUSH), he said.  Approved activities under Schedule VII of CSR include eradicating extreme hunger, poverty, promotion of education, promoting gender equality and women’s empowerment as well as reducing the child mortality, improving maternal health and combating diseases.  Ensuring environmental sustainability and prompting employment enhancing vocational skills are other activities approved under CSR. \",\"document_ocr\":\"saryte\\nMe\\na Ba Kena\\nMea ANa\\na 0,5\\nTatycea:\\n06.208\\n04.2011\\nneparype\\n.\\nteunapal\\nonpene\\n\",\"Category\":\"Insufficient_Text\"},{\"Id\":34981,\"claim_image\":\"http://pbs.twimg.com/media/DxkGVtyWkAAM6rn.jpg?format=jpg&name=large\",\"claim\":\"The White House has reached out to Covington Catholic High School students after video of an encounter between students &amp; an Omaha Nation elder stirred debate.\\n\\n\\\"We've reached out and voiced our support\\\" for the students, press secretary Sarah Sanders said https://t.co/AmZ99NI4pb https://t.co/givq6wNzSf\",\"claim_ocr\":\"RATA\\nMAKEA\\nGREAT A\\nIDEC\\n20\\n\",\"document_image\":\"http://pbs.twimg.com/media/DxndqI2WkAAlNCm.jpg?format=jpg&name=large\",\"document\":\"A Florida detective told investigators that the former deputy entrusted to protect a high school where 17 people died in a mass shooting gave an initial statement filled with inaccuracies about his actionsFORT LAUDERDALE, Fla.  -- A Florida detective told investigators the former deputy entrusted to protect a high school where 17 people died in a mass shooting last year gave an initial statement filled with inaccuracies about his actions. Broward Sheriff's Office Detective John Curcio told investigators that ex-deputy Scot Peterson's story about what happened at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland contains many inconsistencies when compared with video evidence. \\\"There is almost, on every detail that he gave in the statement, inaccuracies,\\\" Curcio said. Curcio is the lead investigator in the criminal case against Nikolas Cruz, 20, who faces the death penalty if convicted in the shooting.  The detective's statement released Tuesday by prosecutors was given to Florida Department of Law Enforcement agents working with a state commission looking into the law enforcement response to the February 2018 mass shooting. The commission, which released a sweeping report critical of the response and recommended improvements, has found Peterson was derelict in his duty for not confronting the gunman and instead staying outside while shots rang out.  The FDLE also has begun a criminal investigation into the response.  Peterson's lawyer declined comment and Peterson himself resigned from the agency months ago. Curcio said Peterson told him two days after the massacre — before Curcio had viewed video of Peterson's actions — that he didn't know where the shots were coming from, thought there may have been a sniper on top of the building and that he only heard up to three shots. \\\"The two to three shots he claims he heard were actually over 70 shots going off inside the building,\\\" Curcio said. Curcio added that Peterson surely knew what his duty was in an active shooter situation. \\\"Every moment you distract the shooter, he's not shooting kids,\\\" Curcio said.  \\\"He's a school resource officer.  He certainly knew what he was supposed to do. \\\"In another development, a judge has denied an effort by defense attorneys to hold the Broward Sheriff's Office in contempt of court for releasing Cruz's medical records to the commission. The order dated Tuesday by Circuit Judge Elizabeth Scherer says the records release was limited, not done in bad faith and was an isolated incident.  Scherer also says the sheriff's office may not have been aware of restrictions she had placed on the records. Defense lawyers wanted Judge Scherer to hold a hearing on whether the sheriff's office should be found in contempt of court for a violating her previous order limiting release of the records. Meanwhile, a California man is accused of using Instagram to \\\"harass and intimidate\\\" the families of students killed in the shooting. A criminal complaint filed in federal court says Brandon Fleury of Santa Ana, California, began the taunts Dec.  22 using different accounts which were traced to an IP address in Santa Ana, where Fleury lives with his father and brother.  He was arrested Friday. Special Agent Cameron McDowell wrote in a 12-page report filed Friday that Fleury showed no remorse when questioned Jan.  16 and that he admitted to a fascination with the mass shooting. Fleury's father, Patrick Fleury, told the SunSentinel it was a \\\"bunch of nonsense\\\" and declined to say whether his son has a lawyer. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events\",\"document_ocr\":\"MARJORY STOMAN DOUGLAS\\nNO MORE\\nUNS\\nGtre\\nHand\\nT Heroes\\nvill make\\nerence.\\nHIGH SCHOOL\\nSOStrong\\ntands by our\\ntvers and Faculty\\nmunity stands by\\nAlh.\\nRhona Wiserhona Wise/AFP/Getty\\n\",\"Category\":\"Insufficient_Text\"},{\"Id\":34982,\"claim_image\":\"http://pbs.twimg.com/media/DxnGoyXX4AARbwz.jpg?format=jpg&name=large\",\"claim\":\"The White House has not responded in writing to Speaker Nancy Pelosi's letter suggesting postponement of the State of the Union speech, her office says https://t.co/Q6aav5VTuM https://t.co/pE6nRqFOva\",\"claim_ocr\":\"STA\\nBRENDAN SMIALOWSKIZAFP/GETTY IMAGES\\n\",\"document_image\":\"http://pbs.twimg.com/media/DxoN3qPX4AAGI9s.jpg?format=jpg&name=large\",\"document\":\"Trump earlier rejected Pelosi's appeal to delay date until after shutdown. Trump agrees to postpone State of the Union amid shutdownThe back and forth between House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and President Donald Trump over when and where the State of the Union will be delivered -- if at all -- came to a conclusion, if temporary, late Wednesday night.  Trump will not give a speech until after the partial government shutdown is over. The president tweeted the news in a two-part missive just before midnight, saying, \\\"As the Shutdown was going on, Nancy Pelosi asked me to give the State of the Union Address.  I agreed.  She then changed her mind because of the Shutdown, suggesting a later date.  This is her prerogative - I will do the Address when the Shutdown is over. \\\"He ended speculation he might look to give the speech in a location other than the House of Representatives as well, saying he's not looking for another venue. In response, Pelosi took the opportunity to encourage the president to support a bill to fund the government while discussions over border security continue. \\\"Mr.  President, I hope by saying 'near future' you mean you will support the House-passed package to #EndTheShutdown that the Senate will vote on tomorrow,\\\" she said.  \\\"Please accept this proposal so we can re-open government, repay our federal workers and then negotiate our differences. \\\"The bill is mostly likely dead on arrival in the Republican-controlled Senate. In the latest twist in their political and seemingly personal feud earlier Wednesday, Pelosi sent a letter to Trump saying there would be no State of the Union address in the House chamber until after the partial government shutdown ends, effectively rescinding her invitation to the president. \\\"When I extended an invitation on January 3rd for you to deliver the State of the Union address, it was on the mutually agreed upon date, January 29th.   At that time, there was no thought that the government would still be shut down,\\\" her letter said. \\\"I am writing to inform you that the House of Representatives will not consider a concurrent resolution authorizing the President’s State of the Union address in the House Chamber until government has opened,\\\" Pelosi, D-Calif. , said. The resolution is necessary to authorize the president to address a joint session of Congress. \\\"Again, I look forward to welcoming you to the House on a mutually agreeable date for this address when government has been opened,\\\" Pelosi's letter continued. At the White House, Trump told reporters he was \\\"not surprised\\\" by Pelosi's letter. \\\"I’m not surprised.  It’s really a shame what’s happening with the Democrats, they’ve become radicalized,\\\" Trump said when asked for reaction to Pelosi's letter during a photo-op in the Roosevelt Room. Later, at another photo op, Trump said, “The State of the Union has been canceled by Nancy Pelosi because she doesn’t want to hear the truth, she doesn't want the American people to hear what's going on. ”“Now Nancy Pelosi, or Nancy as I call her, she doesn’t want to hear the truth and she doesn't want to hear the American people to hear the truth,\\\" Trump said. \\\"I think that’s a great blotch on the great country we all love, it's a great, great horrible mark.  I don't believe it's ever happened before,\\\" Trump said.  \\\"It's always good to be part of history but this is a negative part of history.  This is where people are afraid to open up and say what's going on. \\\"\\\"If we can handle Iraq, we can handle the middle of Washington and the very spectacular building and a beautiful room that we should be in and that's where it's been for a long time,\\\" Trump said. Upon returning to the Capitol after an afternoon speech, Pelosi made clear that Trump is not welcome to address a joint session of Congress until the shutdown is over. \\\"I still make the offer: let's work together on a mutually agreeable date, as the original date was, mutually agreeable, so we can welcome him properly to the Capitol,\\\" she said. House Minority Whip Steve Scalise told reporters that Pelosi’s decision to rescind the invitation is “a big mistake” and “a disgraceful move. ”“The fact that Nancy Pelosi’s not only holding the paychecks of federal workers hostage, now she’s going to try to hold the State of the Union hostage, shows that she is beholden right now to the most radical left elements of her base,” Scalise, R-La. , said.  “She’s not trying to solve this problem. ”Just a couple of hours earlier, Trump on Wednesday rejected Pelosi's earlier suggestion he delay his State of the Union speech until after the partial government shutdown ends, writing Pelosi to formally affirm he was sticking to plans to deliver the address on Jan.  29 in the House chamber. \\\"I will be honoring your invitation, and fulfilling my Constitutional duty, to deliver important information to the people and Congress of the United States of America regarding the State of our Union,\\\" Trump wrote in a letter to Pelosi on Wednesday afternoon. Trump closed the letter by hinting that the onus would be on Pelosi to cancel the invitation.  \\\"I look forward to seeing you on the evening on January 29th in the Chamber of the House of Representative.  It would be so very sad for our Country if the State of the Union were not delivered on time, on schedule, and very importantly, on location! \\\"Recognizing that Pelosi’s invitation was never officially taken off the table, Trump had seemingly called her bluff, resisting pressure to pull out and deliver the address from another venue elsewhere in Washington, such as at the White House or Senate chamber, or even, as one Republican member of Congress suggested, at the southern border. Pelosi wrote Trump on Jan.  16, appealing to the president to work with her to find “another suitable date” after the partial government shutdown ends, or provide his address in writing -- justifying her suggestion with a warning that “critical” operations at the Department of Homeland Security are “hamstrung by furloughs. ”In his letter, Trump said DHS and the U. S.  Secret Service told him \\\"there would be absolutely no problem regarding security with respect to the event. \\\"Despite the uncertainty prior to the letter, preparations were already moving forward to welcome Trump next Tuesday, as Pelosi has not explicitly disinvited him from an invitation to deliver the annual address from the House chamber. “She didn’t disinvite him.  She suggested another date which would be consistent with a government that was open and was paying the people that we expect to protect us,” House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, the No.  2-ranked Democrat, told reporters during a pen and pad briefing Wednesday.  “It is a very high-security event. ”As a matter of congressional protocol, both the House and Senate must pass a concurrent resolution authorizing the president to deliver an address from the House chamber, though neither chamber has acted yet and no votes on such measures are planned this week. Hoyer, who is empowered with control over which measures are considered on the House floor, said a resolution could be considered as late as next Tuesday -- the same day Pelosi has invited Trump to deliver the address -- without impacting security or logistical planning. “I’m told that that could be passed Tuesday the 29th and be equally effective as if we passed it today,” Hoyer said.  “I think the Capitol Police and Sergeant at Arms have assured us we’ll be fully prepared if in fact there’s a State of the Union address on the 29th. ”Rep.  Mike McCaul, the top Republican on the House Foreign Affairs committee, signaled he hopes the president's efforts will generate a solution to the impasse. “This is a time we need the president to come to the Hill and talk to the Congress,\\\" McCaul, R-Texas, said.  \\\"And so I would hope that Speaker Pelosi would just do the right thing – rise above the partisanship and let the president come talk to the Congress. ”While the shutdown continued in its 33rd day, Hoyer says House Democrats are crafting a letter outlining “substantial” spending on border security to “articulate what we believe is effective. ” He urged the president to end the shutdown, enabling lawmakers to negotiate a border security package and even comprehensive immigration reform without the president using 800,000 federal employees as leverage. “I think her suggestion was a reasonable one,” Hoyer said of Pelosi's suggestion to delay the speech until after government reopens.  “The response we got was that the Secret Service will do its job and other security officers will do their job.  There’s no doubt that they will.  They’re very dedicated, patriotic people, very contentious people.  Paying them or not, they’re going to be doing their job.  We understand that but the fact is the president needs to open up the government. ”ABC News' Meridith McGraw, Jordyn Phelps and Sarah Kolinovsky contributed to this report. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events\",\"document_ocr\":\"PELOSI TO TRUMP: FIND ANOTHER VENUE FOR THE STATE OF THE UNION\\nWASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham (R-South Carolina) today made this statement on a letter from Speaker Nancy\\nPelosi that states she will not introduce a concurrent resolution to invite President Trump to deliver the State of the Union address in\\nthe U.S. House of Representatives.

With a surge in cases of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), an increase in fatality rate, widespread accounts of the struggle to get tested or/and get hospital admissions, and a projection of 532,000 cases by the end of July and the need for 150,000 beds by then, the pandemic has truly come home to the national capital.  It was clear that the Delhi government, led by Arvind Kejriwal, needed help.  The fact that Delhi is the Capital, there is a unique division of powers that exists between the Centre and the state, and Delhi’s health facilities are used by citizens across the country made it even more essential for the central government to step in.  On Sunday, following a meeting of the state disaster management authority, home minister Amit Shah announced a set of much-needed, welcome measures.  The testing rate in the Capital will double in the next two days and triple in six days; the Centre will provide 500 railway coaches, which will add another 8,000 beds to Delhi’s health infrastructure; there will be rigorous contact tracing in containment zones; a high-level committee, within two days, will submit a report on rates to be charged by private hospitals for testing and treatment; new guidelines will be framed for funerals to reduce the waiting time for cremations and burials; the Centre will depute five senior officials to help Delhi with the health crisis; a joint team will inspect facilities in all Covid-19 hospitals; and the Centre will provide oxygen cylinders, ventilators, and other health supplies to the Delhi government. Each of these measures is necessary.  Ramping up testing is the only way to trace the infected and prevent further transmission.  Contact tracing had almost collapsed in the city — and a renewed effort is much-needed.  Private hospitals must be more responsible in their fee structures in times of the pandemic and a degree of regulation will help.  Delhi needs support from all quarters to enhance hospital facilities and beds.  What is inexplicable is why all of this was not done earlier, and why the period of the lockdown was not used better to anticipate the current situation and prepare for it.  Belated as these interventions are, it is welcome and the focus must now be on implementing it.  It is also important to constantly review Delhi’s battle against Covid-19, and provide additional support if necessary.  For the sake of Delhi’s citizens, the Centre and the Delhi government must continue to work together at this moment.  \",\"document_ocr\":\"ANI\\n\",\"Category\":\"Insufficient_Text\"},{\"Id\":34987,\"claim_image\":\"https://images.hindustantimes.com/rf/image_size_630x354/HT/p2/2020/06/07/Pictures/assignment-name-in-brief_fd4a59a6-a878-11ea-ad77-c76040589f9e.jpg\",\"claim\":\"With a tally of 2,46,628 infections, India is now the fifth worst-hit country in the world. #Covid19 \\n\\nhttps://t.co/5lLVQs6eMG\",\"claim_ocr\":\"\",\"document_image\":\"http://pbs.twimg.com/media/Eevz0aDUYAEEF7c.png?format=jpg&name=large\",\"document\":\"India on Sunday reported 9,971 new cases of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) and 287 deaths, another highest spike, were recorded in the last 24 hours, the Union health ministry data showed.

The full text of his letter is below:\\n\\n\\n  Dear Chairman Graham, Chairman Nadler, Ranking Member Feinstein, and Ranking Member Collins:  \\n\\n  As a supplement to the notification provided on Friday, March 22, 2019, I am writing today to advise you of the principal conclusions reached by Special Counsel Robert S.  Mueller and to inform you about the status of my initial review of the report he has prepared.   \\n\\nThe Special Counsel’s Report  \\n\\n  On Friday, the Special Counsel submitted to me a “confidential report explaining the prosecution or declination decisions” he has reached, as required by 28 C. F. R.  § 600. 8(c).  This report is entitled “Report on the Investigation into Russian Interference in the 2016 Presidential Election. ” Although my review is ongoing, I believe that it is in the public interest to describe the report and to summarize the principal conclusions reached by the Special Counsel and the results of his investigation.   \\n\\n  The report explains that the Special Counsel and his staff thoroughly investigated allegations that members of the presidential campaign of Donald J.  Trump, and others associated with it, conspired with the Russian government in its efforts to interfere in the 2016 U. S.  presidential election, or sought to obstruct the related federal investigations.  In the report, the Special Counsel noted that, in completing his investigation, he employed 19 lawyers who were assisted by a team of approximately 40 FBI agents, intelligence forensic accountants, and other professional staff.  The Special Counsel issued more than 2,800 subpoenas, executed nearly 500 search warrants, obtained more than 230 orders for communication records, issued almost 50 orders authorizing use of pen registers, made 13 requests to foreign governments for evidence, and interviewed approximately 500 witnesses.  \\n\\n  The Special Counsel obtained a number of indictments and convictions of individuals and entities in connection with his investigation, all of which have been publicly disclosed.  During the course of his investigation, the Special Counsel also referred several matters to other offices for further action.  The report does not recommend any further indictments, nor did the Special Counsel obtain any sealed indictments that have yet to be made public.  Below, I summarize the principal conclusions set out in the Special Counsel’s report. \\n\\nRussian Interference in the 2016 U. S.  Presidential Election.  The Special Counsel’s report is divided into two parts.  The first describes the results of the Special Counsel’s investigation into Russia’s interference in the 2016 U. S.  presidential election.  The report outlines the Russian effort to influence the election and documents crimes committed by persons associated with the Russian government in connection with those efforts.  The report further explains that a primary consideration for the Special Counsel’s investigation was whether any Americans  including individuals associated with the Trump campaign joined the Russian conspiracies to influence the election, which would be a federal crime.  The Special Counsel’s investigation did not find that the Trump campaign or anyone associated with it conspired or coordinated with Russia in its efforts to influence the 2016 U. S.  presidential election.  As the report states: “[T]he investigation did not establish that members of the Trump Campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities. ” 1\\n\\n  The Special Counsel’s investigation determined that there were two main Russian efforts to influence the 2016 election.  The first involved attempts by a Russian organization, the Internet Research Agency (IRA), to conduct disinformation and social media operations in the United States designed to sow social discord, eventually with the aim of interfering with the election.  As noted above, the Special Counsel did not find that any U. S.  person or Trump campaign official or associate conspired or knowingly coordinated with the IRA in its efforts, although the Special Counsel brought criminal charges against a number of Russian nationals and entities in connection with these activities. \\n\\n  The second element involved the Russian government’s efforts to conduct computer hacking operations designed to gather and disseminate information to influence the election.  The Special Counsel found that Russian government actors successfully hacked into computers and obtained emails from persons affiliated with the Clinton campaign and Democratic Party organizations, and publicly disseminated those materials through various intermediaries, including WikiLeaks.  Based on these activities, the Special Counsel brought criminal charges against a number of Russian military officers for conspiring to hack into computers in the United States for purposes of influencing the election.  But as noted above, the Special Counsel did not find that the Trump campaign, or anyone associated with it, conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in these efforts, despite multiple offers from Russian-affiliated individuals to assist the Trump campaign. \\n\\nFootnote: 1 In assessing potential conspiracy charges, the Special Counsel also considered whether members of the Trump campaign “coordinated” with Russia election interference activities.  The Special Counsel defined “coordination” as an “agreement—tacit or express—between the Trump Campaign and the Russian government on election interference. ”\\n\\nObstruction of Justice.  The report’s second part addresses a number of actions by the President most of which have been the subject of public reporting that the Special Counsel investigated as potentially raising obstruction-of-justice concerns.  After making a “thorough factual investigation” into these matters, the Special Counsel considered whether to evaluate the conduct under Department standards governing prosecution and declination decisions but ultimately determined not to make a traditional prosecutorial judgment.  The Special Counsel therefore did not draw a conclusion one way or the other as to whether the examined conduct constituted obstruction.  Instead, for each of the relevant actions investigated, the report sets out evidence on both sides of the question and leaves unresolved what the Special Counsel views as “difficult issues” of law and fact concerning whether the President’s actions and intent could be viewed as obstruction.  The Special Counsel states that “while this report does not conclude that the President committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him. ”\\n\\n  The Special Counsel’s decision to describe the facts of his obstruction investigation without reaching any legal conclusions leaves it to the Attorney General to determine whether the conduct described in the report constitutes a crime.  Over the course of the investigation, the Special Counsel’s office engaged in discussions with certain Department officials regarding many of the legal and factual matters at issue in the Special Counsel’s obstruction investigation.  After reviewing the Special Counsel’s final report on these issues; consulting with Department officials, including the Office of Legal Counsel; and applying the principles of federal prosecution that guide our charging decisions, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and I have concluded that the evidence developed during the Special Counsel’s investigation is not sufficient to establish that the President committed an obstruction-of-justice offense.  Our determination was made without regard to, and is not based on, the constitutional considerations that surround the indictment and criminal prosecution of a sitting president.  2\\n\\n  In making this determination, we noted that the Special Counsel recognized that “the evidence does not establish that the President was involved in an underlying crime related to Russian election interference,” and that, while not determinative, the absence of such evidence bears upon the President’s intent with respect to obstruction.  Generally speaking, to obtain and sustain an obstruction conviction, the government would need to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that a person, acting with corrupt intent, engaged in obstructive conduct with a sufficient nexus to a pending or contemplated proceeding.  In cataloguing the President’s actions, many of which took place in public view, the report identifies no actions that, in our judgment, constitute obstructive conduct, had a nexus to a pending or contemplated proceeding, and were done with corrupt intent, each of which, under the Department’s principles of federal prosecution guiding charging decisions, would need to be proven beyond a reasonable doubt to establish an obstruction-of-justice offense. \\n\\nFootnote: 2 See A Sitting President’s Amenability to Indictment and Criminal Prosecution, 24 Op.  O. L. C.  222 (2000)\\n\\nStatus of the Department’s Review\\n\\n  The relevant regulations contemplate that the Special Counsel’s report will be a “confidential report” to the Attorney General.  See Office of Special Counsel, 64 Fed.  Reg.  37,038, 37,040-41 (July 9, 1999).  As I have previously stated, however, I am mindful of the public interest in this matter.  For that reason, my goal and intent is to release as much of the Special Counsel’s report as I can consistent with applicable law, regulations, and Departmental policies. \\n\\n  Based on my discussions with the Special Counsel and my initial review, it is apparent that the report contains material that is or could be subject to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure which imposes restrictions on the use and disclosure of information relating to “matter[s] occurring before grand jury. ” Fed.  R.  Crim.  P.  6(e)(2)(B)  Rule 6(e) generally limits disclosure of certain grand jury information in a criminal investigation and prosecution.  Id.  Disclosure of 6(e) material beyond the strict limits set forth in the rule is a crime in certain circumstances.  See, e. g.  18 U. S. C.  401(3).  This restriction protects the integrity of grand jury proceedings and ensures that the unique and invaluable investigative powers of a grand jury are used strictly for their intended criminal justice function. \\n\\n  Given these restrictions, the schedule for processing the report depends in part on how quickly the Department can identify the 6(e) material that by law cannot be made public.  I have requested the assistance of the Special Counsel in identifying all 6(e) information contained in the report as quickly as possible.  Separately, I also must identify any information that could impact other ongoing matters, including those that the Special Counsel has referred to other offices.  As soon as that process is complete, I will be in a position to move forward expeditiously in determining what can be released in light of applicable law, regulations, and Departmental policies. \\n\\n  * * *\\n\\n  As I observed in my initial notification, the Special Counsel regulations provide that “the Attorney General may determine that public release of” notifications to your respective Committees “would be in the public interest. ” 28 C. F. R.  § 600. 9(c).  I have so determined, and I will disclose this letter to the public after delivering it to you. \\n\\n  Sincerely,\\n\\n  William P.

However, the central government requested state governments to \\\"rethink\\\" their decisions to impose ban sale of poultry products and allow sale of poultry items sourced from the non-infected areas/states. In India, bird flu or avian influenza is spread mainly by migratory birds coming into India during winter months from between September and March.  The disease is zoonotic. Releasing latest update on bird flu situation, the Union Ministry of Fisheries, Animal Husbandry and Dairying said bird flu cases have been confirmed in poultry in Latur, Parbhani, Nanded, Pune, Solapur, Yavatmal, Ahmednagar, Beed and Raigad districts of Maharashtra till Saturday. Unusual mortality of poultry has been found in a farm as per the report received from the Mumbai-based Central Poultry Development Organisation.

Additionally in Delhi, Pigeon and brown fish owl in Najafgarh and Heron in Rohini have tested positive for avian influenza, the statement said. On culling operation in poultry, the ministry said it is underway in epicentres of Balod district, Chhattisgarh. Further in Madhya Pradesh also rapid response teams have been deployed.  Culling operation of poultry is underway in the epicentre of Harda district, it added. According to the ministry, the central teams formed for monitoring the situation in the affected areas of the country are visiting the affected sites and conducting epistemological studies.

ABC News Live-House managers make 2nd day of arguments at Senate impeachment trial-Lead manager Adam Schiff: Focus on first article alleging 'abuse of power'-President Trump's constitutional lawyer Alan Dershowitz argues a president cannot be impeached for 'abuse of power'-Schumer says a Trump acquittal will have 'zero value' if no witnesses-Graham compliments Schiff on presentation of House case, but asks 'will it stand up? -Nadler: Trump 'puts President Nixon to shame' in abusing power-Trump legal team concerned Saturday arguments will get buried, may request time changeAs the Senate trial of President Donald Trump resumed Thursday afternoon, lead House manager Adam Schiff argued the law and the Constitution, applied to the facts, support the article of impeachment that accuses him of \\\"abuse of power. \\\"On Wednesday, after laying out the timeline of Trump's pressure campaign against Ukraine, including withholding military aid to get Ukraine to announce an investigation of former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter, Schiff argued that the president violated the Constitution. Alan Dershowitz, the former Harvard Law School professor who is playing a role on Trump's defense team, is expected to argue, as he's been doing on TV, that a sitting president cannot be impeached for abuse of power as Democrats charge. Also on Wednesday, the first of three days of opening arguments, Democrats flatly dismissed the notion of offering Joe or Hunter Biden as witnesses in exchange for Trump's former national security adviser John Bolton. \\\"That trade is not on the table,\\\" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer told reporters. As Thursday's session opened, Chief Justice John Roberts announced that Democrats had 16 hours and 42 minutes left to use over two days before the president's legal team takes the Senate floor on Saturday to begin 24 hours of opening arguments over three days. The ABC News team of correspondents and producers is covering every aspect of the story. This is how the day is unfolding.  Please refresh for updates. In his final statements for the day, Rep.  Adam Schiff wrapped up arguments by pointing senators back to the transcript of the Zelenskiy-Trump July 25 phone call, asking senators to view the transcript in the context of the information they'd been listening to all day.  Schiff ended on an impassioned note, telling senators that Trump's actions demonstrate that he cannot be trusted to act in the best interest of the country, and telling them that they must remove Trump if they find he is guilty of the actions he's accused of. Schiff used the end of his time to argue against the narrative that Republicans seem to be getting ready to argue.  He asked senators to consider, if Trump is guilty, does he really need to be removed from office for these actions? \\\"If you find him guilty you must find that he should be removed,\\\" Schiff said, \\\"because right matters.  Because right matters and the truth matters, otherwise we are lost. \\\"Schiff said Trump's decision to \\\"choose Rudy Giuliani\\\" over the guidance of national security advisers, the FBI and the country shows that Trump is self-interested and cannot be trusted to act in the country's best interest leading up to the election, especially with anticipated election security threats from Russia and China. \\\"You may be asking, 'How much damage can he really do in the next several months until the election? ' Schiff said.  \\\"A lot.  A lot of damage. \\\"Schiff ended by pointing to remarks from Lt.  Col.  Alexander Vindman, who said during his House testimony that \\\"right matters. \\\" Schiff repeated it multiple times before closing. \\\"If right doesn't matter, it doesn't matter how good the Constitution is.  It doesn't matter how brilliant the framers were.  It doesn't matter how good or bad our advocacy in this trial is,\\\" he said.  \\\"If right doesn't matter, we're lost.  If the truth doesn't matter, we're lost. \\\"He also threw some of the president's remarks back at him. \\\"At the beginning of the trial you may have seen the president tweeted a common refrain: 'Read the transcript,' so I thought at the end of the evening I would join in the president's request that you re-read the transcript because now that you know a lot more of the facts of this scheme it reveals a lot more about that conversation. \\\"-- ABC News' Allie PecorinWith Republican senators sounding increasingly irritated by the managers' presentation during their breaks -- telling reporters they are repetitive, etc.  -- the managers continued to thank the senators for listening. House Manager Rep.  Zoe Lofgren said, \\\"It's a long day.  You are here without your cellphones or any access to other information.  It's not easy, but you're paying attention, and the country and the managers thank you for that. Rep.  Jason Crow later echoed the same message as the clock neared 9:30 p. m. : \\\"Just bear with us a little while longer.  I promise we are almost there. \\\"Lofgren used her time after a brief recess to detail the hold on military aid to Ukraine, how Trump \\\"knowingly\\\" and \\\"willfully\\\" broke the law by freezing it and how that related to his abuse of power. \\\"The hold had nothing to do with the national interest.  It had to do with the interest of just one person: Donald J Trump.  The demand for Ukraine to announce these investigations was not a policy decision but a personal decision by the president to benefit his own personal interests,\\\" Lofgren said. She also pulled out a pocket Constitution to remind senators of their responsibilities. \\\"Every year we print a new copy of the Constitution and this year in the back we printed a quote.  At the conclusion of the Constitutional Convention, Benjamin Franklin was asked, 'What have you wrought? ' and he answered, 'A republic, if you can keep it. ' That's the challenge that all of us face and that you senators face. \\\"Senate Republican leadership is laying the groundwork in its caucus for a vote against subpoenaing witnesses by warning that a guaranteed White House court fight over executive privilege would stall the trial and paralyze the Senate for months. Former Attorney General Michael Mukasey was called in on Wednesday to lay out the scenarios for GOP senators, sources familiar with the meeting told ABC News. Mukasey explained how \\\"cumbersome\\\" it would be to subpoena any of the four White House officials sought by the House Democratic managers, the sources said. Several Republicans in the meeting have told us that they'd expect an executive privilege fight over a Senate trial subpoena to take \\\"weeks or months\\\" leaving the body no choice but to remain idle. “There’d be nothing else we could do in the interim,” said Sen John Cornyn of Texas.  “It would basically hijack the senate.  In the meantime, the Senate can't do anything else; we can't confirm judges, we can't have hearings, we can't even introduce legislation. ”Sen.  John Barrasso of Wyoming said lawmakers would get an earful from their constituents -- especially independent voters. \\\"Every day we spend doing this, we're not doing -- I'm a doctor.  I want to lower the cost of insulin.  I want to deal with this surprise medical billings issue.  . . .  But because we're stuck with this, and the longer you are going, and the longer you're dealing with witnesses, the harder it is to get to the things that I hear about in Wyoming. \\\"-- ABC News' Devin DwyerRep.  Hakeem Jeffries continued speaking when the Senate returned from its break around 7:15 p. m. Jeffries' presentation got into the minutia of attempts by top officials to get a meeting planned between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy.  He pointed to multiple instances in which the importance of an investigation was emphasized as a necessary concession to getting a meeting scheduled. \\\"President Trump had immense power over Ukraine and President Trump knew it, so when President Trump asked for a favor on the July 25 call he knew that President Zelenskiy would feel incredible pressure to do exactly what President Trump wanted,\\\" Jeffries said. After displaying text messages between administration officials, Jeffries sampled a portion of the phone call between Trump and Zelenskiy in which Zelenskiy again emphasizes his desire for a White House meeting and spoke to his efforts to possibly pursue \\\"the investigation. \\\" Jeffries said the transcript is damning. \\\"Read the transcript, President Trump says.  We have read the transcript and it is damning evidence of a corrupt quid pro quo,\\\" Jeffries said.  \\\"The evidence against Donald Trump is hiding in plain sight. \\\"Jeffries concluded his comments at 7:47 p. m.  -- and Sylvia Garcia took to the podium.  She continued presenting evidence laying out attempts by Rudy Giuliani to get confirmation of an investigation, and by administration officials to get a meeting scheduled. \\\"The evidence is very clear the White House meeting would only be scheduled if Ukraine announced the investigations that everyone, including the Ukrainians, understood to be purely political efforts to benefit the president,\\\" Garcia said.  \\\"The only way to come to a different conclusion is to ignore the evidence. \\\"-- ABC News' Allie PecorinFollowing a series of tweets Thursday afternoon by Sen.  Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn. , which questioned Lt.  Col.  Alexander Vindman's motivation to testify and his patriotism, his attorney slammed the comments. \\\"This difficult moment in our country calls for seriousness and seriousness of purpose,\\\" David Pressman, who serves as counsel to the Army officer who defied White House orders and appeared before the House impeachment probe, said in a statement. \\\"Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Vindman has sacrificed enormously for our country.  He believes in our country.  And he believes in our country’s great institutions, including the United States Senate,\\\" the statement continued.  \\\"That a member of the Senate -- at a moment when the Senate is undertaking its most solemn responsibility -- would choose to take to Twitter to spread slander about a member of the military is a testament to cowardice.  While Senator Blackburn fires off defamatory tweets, Lieutenant Colonel Vindman will continue to do what he has always done: serve our country dutifully and with honor. \\\"-- ABC News' Benjamin SiegelOver the past hour, House managers Zoe Lofgren and then Val Demings have laid out in detail Rudy Giuliani's efforts, they argue, to conduct shadow diplomacy in Ukraine to further President Trump's political interests, culminating in the firing of Ambassador Marie Yovanovich. Just as the managers have used Trump's own words against him in clips, this hour of presentation featured multiple videos of Giuliani's prolific media appearances, peddling what Democrats call conspiracy theories, including his comments in this Fox News video clip:\\\"That there were a group of people in the Ukraine working to help Hillary Clinton and were colluding really with the Clinton campaign and it stems around the ambassador and the embassy being used for political purposes.  So I began getting some people that were coming forward and telling me about that.  Then all of a sudden they revealed this story about Burisma and Biden's son and Biden's son being on the board,\\\" Giuliani said in a Fox News appearance. Demings and Lofgren use WhatsApp exchanges provided by indicted Giuliani associated Lev Parnas between himself and Giuliani as more evidence that Giuliani pushed for the firing of Yovanovich. \\\"President Trump removed Ambassador Yovanovitch because she was in the way.  She was in the way of the sham investigations that he so desperately wanted.  Investigations that would hurt former Vice President Biden and undermine the Mueller investigation into Russia election interference.  Investigations that would help him cheat in the 2020 elections,\\\" Demings insisted. And they played the damning bite from EU Ambassador Gordon Sondland, when he admitted that though he believed State Department personnel should take responsibility for Ukraine matters, he felt he had no choice but to conduct diplomacy through Giuliani. \\\"We chose the latter course, not because we liked it, but because it was the only constructive path open to us,\\\" Sondland said in the clip- ABC News' Sarah KolinovskyHouse manager Val Demings of Florida countered the Republican accusation that Democrats are trying to skew the 2020 presidential election away from President Trump. \\\"This trial is much bigger than any one election and it's much bigger than any one president.  This moment is about the American people, this moment is about ensuring that every voter, whether a maid or a janitor, whether a nurse or a teacher or a truck driver, whether a doctor or mechanic, that their vote matters and that American elections are decided by the American people,\\\" she says. Some senators appeared restless as the arguments continued in the afternoon session. GOP Sen.  Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee slid her desk drawer open revealing a copy of “Resistance at All Costs” by Kimberly Strassel. Blackburn also used a blanket to stay warm as did Republican Sen.  Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia. Sen.  Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota enjoyed some chewing gum as she observed Schiff’s performance. Sen.  Richard Burr ordered a glass of milk from a page at 3:31 p. m.  Three minutes later, at 3:34 p. m. , the milk was delivered to his desk, and he quickly chugged more than half before setting it down.  By 3:39 p. m. , the milk was fully consumed and a page quickly cleared his empty glass. I noted at 3:48 p. m.  that every senator was at his or her desk.  None were standing or absent at that point.  Adam Schiff had the room’s full attention. -ABC News' John ParkinsonIt was interesting to watch Schiff seemingly direct parts of his monologue on Ukraine and Russia at Utah Republican Mitt Romney - who is seated in the back row to Schiff’s left. Romney -- famously a Russia hawk -- appeared riveted as Schiff laid out his argument that Trump's actions toward Ukraine implicates Russia and Putin. The two seemed to be making eye contact from my vantage point. Romney was noting line by line down his notepad the enumerated ways that Schiff said Donald Trump “put himself first. ”Overall, the entire chamber seemed to me much more engaged than yesterday afternoon.  Most senators on both sides could be seen watching the Democratic slideshow and taking notes. Only GOP Sen.  Tom Cotton of Arkansas was using a fidget spinner, as far as I could tell. -ABC News' Devin DwyerAs Schiff continues to lay out the Democrats' argument, he targets an expected talking point for the defense -- that Trump was legitimately concerned about corruption within Ukraine. Schiff argues that then-incoming Ukrainian President Zelenskiy had run on a campaign of reforming corruption, so why was it Trump's focus now instead of on the former administration? He adds that President Trump badmouthed U. S.  Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch in his July 25 call with Zelenskiy, despite her reputation for being a strong corruption-fighter in Ukraine. He repeats the point that Trump's interest in Ukraine only came after Joe Biden became a rival candidate for the presidency in 2020. \\\"The evidence is consistent.  It establishes clearly that President Trump did not care about corruption, to the contrary he was pursuing a corrupt aim.  He wanted Ukraine to do the exact thing that American policy officials have tried for years to stop foreign governments from doing - corrupt investigations of political rivals,\\\" Schiff said. Earlier in the afternoon session, Schiff continued to lay out evidence to support the reasons the Democrats say President Trump put his own personal and political interests ahead of his official responsibilities. At one point he scrolled through photos of other presidents on calls with world leaders to make a point that the purpose of those calls is to encourage other countries to do what is in the best interest of the country. Schiff said that when Trump used a call with a foreign leader -- the president of Ukraine--  to push for investigations that would benefit him personally -- it was an abuse of power. \\\"President Trump abused his authority as commander in chief and chief diplomat to benefit himself and he betrayed the interest of the American people when he did so,\\\" Schiff said. To add to his argument, Schiff cited quotes from the president's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, in The New York Times where Giuliani was quoted saying \\\"someone could say it isn't foreign policy and it's improper\\\" and \\\"my only client is the president of the United States. \\\"Several GOP sources tell ABC News that senators are actively considering an abbreviated session this Saturday. The Trump legal team is concerned about their opening arguments getting buried on a Saturday.  The situation is fluid, but these same sources tell ABC that the time frame is roughly 10 a. m.  until possibly 1 p. m. “Save 10-1, expect 10-twelvish,” one senior administration official said. One GOP source said eliminating the Saturday session is also a possibility, but again, the situation is fluid. When asked whether there would be a short session on Saturday, the president personal attorney, Jay Sekulow, says, \\\"The Senate sets the rules on how we go, so we'll see how that goes. \\\"Prior to now, he's said that \\\"we're going to begin our robust case when the Senate says it's time to start. \\\"Sekulow said that if the Senate wants them to go two hours they will, if they want them to go eight hours, fine -- responding to questions about whether they are saving their major presentation for Monday. \\\"I am confident that whether it is Saturday or Monday or Tuesday that the case will be made defending the president.  I have no doubt,\\\" he says. --ABC News' Trish Turner and Katherine Faulders House manager Sylvia Garcia lays out evidence the Democrats' say support that Trump abused his power in pushing for investigations into the Bidens and the Ukrainian energy company Burisma. She says the timeline and lack of evidence that Ukraine interfered in the 2016 election show that Trump's push for the investigations was politically motivated to benefit his campaign and based on Russian misinformation that Ukraine, and not Russia, interfered in American elections. \\\"What is so dangerous is that President Trump is helping them perpetuate this.  Our own president is helping our adversary attack our processes and help his own re-election,\\\" she says. “As soon as President Trump took office, he increased military support to Ukraine in 2017 and in the next year, 2018, but it wasn't until 2019, over three years after Vice President Biden called for Viktor Shokin's removal (Shokin, Ukraine's prosecutor general, was ousted in 2016) --three years after -- that President Trump started pushing Ukraine to investigate his alleged conduct.  So what changed?  What changed?  Why did President Trump not care at all about Biden's request for the removal of Shokin the year after it happened in 2017?  Or the next year in 2018?  Senators, you know what changed in 2019 -when President Trump suddenly cared --  it is that Biden got in the race.  On April 25, Vice President Biden announced he would run for president in 2020,\\\" she says. Fidget spinners --- that’s apparently one thing you can bring into the Senate chamber for a distraction when you're not allowed to have your cell phone or other electronics. As the Democratic arguments continue for a second hour, GOP Sen.  Richard Burr is the only one who has used his -- on and off so far. No milk drinkers yet.  Republican Sen.  Rand Paul has drawn a very impressive sketch of the U. S.  Capitol.  After further examination, however, it appears he is tracing it.  He has placed it on his desk so as to display it to the press above.  It’s the only writing on his white legal pad. GOP Sen.  Marcia Blackburn is reading a novel (it's unclear which one) but the book below the current novel she’s reading is “The Case for Trump. \\\"Republican Sen.  Cindy Hyde-Smith, who is sitting next to Blackburn, has the book “The Chosen” on her desk, but hasn’t started reading it yet. Most senators are taking notes and following along with the presentations.  They have printouts of the slides and video elements the Democrats are using. When the clip of Sen.  Graham was played Graham was the only senator absent from the chamber.  Some Republicans smirked when they looked over and saw he wasn't there. - ABC News' Katherine FauldersNadler boils down the Democratic case to the \\\"ABCs of impeachment. \\\"\\\"Abuse: We will show that President Trump abused his power when he used his office to solicit and pressure Ukraine to meddle in our elections for his personal gain.  Betrayal: We will show that he betrayed vital national interests, specifically our national security, by withholding diplomatic support and military aid from Ukraine even as it faced armed Russian aggression.  Corruption: President Trump's intent was to corrupt our elections to his personal political benefit.  He put his personal interest in retaining power above free and fair elections and above the principle that Americans must govern themselves without interference from abroad. \\\"Article One thus charges a high crime and misdemeanor that blends abuse of power, betrayal of the nation, and corruption in elections into a single unforgiveable scheme.  That is why this president must be removed from office, especially before he continues his effort to corrupt our next election,\\\" Nadler says. Citing legal scholars who agree with the House case, Nadler cites the former Harvard Law School professor who will argue for Trump on the Senate floor that the Constitution does not support that a president can be impeached for abuse of power. \\\"Another who comes to mind is professor Alan Dershowitz.  At least Alan Dershowitz in 1998.  Back then here is what he had to say about impeachment for abuse of power,\\\" Nadler says before showing  a video clip of Dershowitz from 1988. \\\"It certainly doesn't have to be a crime.  If you have somebody who completely corrupts the office of president and who abuses trust and who poses great danger to our liberty, you don't need a technical crime,\\\" Dershowitz says in the clip. \\\"But we need not look to 1998 to find one of President Trump's key allies espousing this view.  Consider the comments of our current Attorney General William Barr, a man known for his extraordinarily expansive view of executive power.  In Attorney General Barr's view, as expressed about 18 months ago, presidents cannot be indicted or criminally investigated, but that's okay because they can impeached.  That's the safeguard,\\\" Nadler says as a memo written by Barr in June 2018 appears in exhibits. \\\"And in an impeachment, Attorney General Barr added, the president is answerable for any abuses of discretion and may be held accountable under law for misdeeds in office.  In other words, Attorney General Barr, who believes along with the office of legal counsel that a president may not be indicted believes that that's okay, we don't need that safeguard against a president who would commit abuses of power.  It's okay because he can be impeached.  That's the safeguard for abuses of discretion and for his misdeeds in office,\\\" Nadler quotes Barr as writing. \\\"When the president betrays our national security and foreign policy interests for his own personal gain, he is unquestionably subject to impeachment and removal,\\\" Nadler continues.  \\\"The same is true of a different concern raised by the framers, the use of presidential power to corrupt the elections and the office of the presidency.  As Madison emphasized, because the presidency was to be administered by a single man, his corruption might be fatal to the republic. \\\"Anticipating another of the arguments from Trump's defense team --- that no specific crime is alleged-- Nadler says, \\\"In a last ditch legal defense of their client, the president's lawyers argue that impeachment and removal are subject to statutory crimes or to offenses against established law, that the president cannot be impeached because he has not committed a crime.  This view is completely wrong.  It has no support in constitutional text and structure, original meeting, congressional presence, common sense or the consensus of credible experts.  In other words, it conflicts with every relevant consideration. \\\"Then, he uses a video clip of GOP Sen.  Lindsey Graham, who had left the chamber. \\\"I might say the same thing of then House manager Lindsey Graham who in President Clinton's trial flatly rejected the notion that impeachable offenses are limited to violation of established law,\\\" Nadler says before playing a clip from Graham on the Senate floor in Clinton's 1999 impeachment trail. \\\"What's a high crime?  How about if an important person hurts somebody of low means?  It's not very scholarly, but I think it's the truth.  I think that's what they meant by high crimes.  Doesn't even have to be a crime.  It's just when you start using your office and you're acting in a way that hurts people, you have committed a high crime,\\\" Graham says in the clip. Rep.  Jerry Nadler, D-N. Y. , one of the lead House impeachment managers takes the floor after Schiff to begin outlining the charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. \\\"President Trump used the powers of his office to solicit a foreign nation to interfere in our elections for his own personal benefit.  Note, that the act of solicitation itself, just the ask, constitutes an abuse of power.  But President Trump went further,\\\" he says. \\\"The president's conduct is wrong.  It is illegal.  It is dangerous, and it captures the worst fears of our founders and the framers of the Constitution,\\\" Nadler says.  \\\"No president has ever used his office to compel a foreign nation to help him cheat in our elections.  Prior presidents would be shocked to the core by such conduct, and rightly so. \\\"This presidential stonewalling of Congress is unprecedented in the 238-year history of our constitutional republic.  It puts even President Nixon to shame.  Taken together, the articles and the evidence conclusively establish that President Trump has placed his own personal political interests first.  He has placed them above our national security, above our free and fair elections, and above our system of checks and balances.  This conduct is not America first, it is Donald Trump first,\\\" Nadler says. \\\"Donald Trump swore an oath to faithfully execute the laws.  That means putting the nation's interests above his own, and the president has repeatedly, flagrantly violated his oath. \\\"Schiff again took the lead as Democrats begin a second of opening arguments. But first he offers some humor, possibly referring to reports of restless senators talking and walking around the chamber -- and some leaving. \\\"I am not sure the chief justice is fully aware of just how rare it is, how extraordinary it is for the House members to be able to command the attention of senators sitting silently for hours or even for minutes for that matter.  Of course, it doesn't hurt that the morning starts out every day with a sergeant at arms warning you that if you don't, you will be imprisoned. \\\"Then he outlines how House managers will go through the first article and what he says are the constitutional underpinnings of abuse of power. \\\"You have now heard hundreds of hours of deposition and live testimony from the House condensed into an abbreviated narrative of the facts.  We will now show you these facts and many others and how they are interwoven.  You will see some of these facts and videos therefore in a new context, in a new light, in the light of what else we know and why it compels a finding of guilt and conviction, so there is some method to our madness. \\\"Sen.  Lindsey Graham, R-S. C. , speaks to reporters shortly before Thursday's proceedings begin, and when asked about a reported he had with Schiff after Wednesday's trial session ended, Graham confirms that he complimented Schiff, a fellow former prosecutor, on his presentation. \\\"He's well-spoken, did a good job of creating a tapestry, taking bits and pieces of evidence and emails and giving a rhetorical flourish making the email come alive,\\\" he says.  \\\"Quite frankly, I thought they did a good job of taking bits and pieces of the evidence and creating a quilt out of it,\\\" he says.  \\\"But will it stand up? \\\"\\\"The point is: let's see what the other side says then we'll make a decision about what the president actually did or didn't do,\\\" he adds.  \\\"All I can do tell you is it from the presidents point of view, he did nothing wrong, in his mind. \\\"\\\"There are bunch of people on my side who want to call Joe Biden and Hunter Biden.  I want to end this thing sooner rather than later,\\\" Graham says, explaining he will not vote for witness and documents.  \\\"I want the American people to pick the next president not me, and so what I think is the best thing to happen is to have oversight of Ukrainian potential misconduct and move on to the election.  I am not going to use my vote to extend the trial,\\\" Graham continues. \\\"I love Joe Biden, but I can tell you, if the name was 'Trump' a lot of questions would be asked. \\\"At a morning news conference, without saying their names, Schumer calls again on four Republican senators -- Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Susan Collins of Maine, Mitt Romney of Utah and Lamar Alexander of Tennessee -- to join Democrats in calling for witnesses and documents, before directly addressing the president and his GOP allies. \\\"I will say this to president than any of my Republican friends: if the American people believe this is not a fair trial, which right now they seem to believe because there were no witnesses and documents, acquittal will have zero value to the president or to the Republicans,\\\"  he says. \\\"The bottom line is the president is clearly covering up, his people are covering up, and the question is: Will our Republican colleagues rise to their constitutional mandate to create a fair trial? \\\" Schumer adds, \\\"and I don't think it will sit very well with history or with the American people if they don't. \\\"Asked about reports of possible deal on witnesses, Schumer says not a single Republican has approached him on the subject -- further shutting down the idea. \\\"No Republicans are talking to us about deals.  We want these four witnesses . . .  they go to the truth,\\\" he says.  (Yesterday, when asked a similar question, Schumer said witnesses should be relevant to the case, seeming to say a deal involving Biden testimony would be off the table for him.  Today's answer seems a bit more open-ended. )--ABC News' Sarah Kolinovsky24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events\",\"document_ocr\":\"\",\"Category\":\"Insufficient_Text\"},{\"Id\":34993,\"claim_image\":\"http://pbs.twimg.com/media/Et2_9O3VcAMRmk1.jpg?format=jpg&name=large\",\"claim\":\"#WATCH LIVE via ANI FB: Prime Minister Narendra Modi replies in Lok Sabha to the Motion of Thanks on the President’s Address.\\n\\nhttps://t.co/3mo97GEPcV\\n\\n(Source: Lok Sabha TV) https://t.co/I1puiyBpav\",\"claim_ocr\":\"LSTV\\nल भा\\nLIVE\\nIN THE\\nCHAIR\\nOM BIRLA, Hon'ble Speaker\\nTHE PRESIDENT'S ADDRESS\\n04:16PM 10.02.2021\\nराष्ट्रछ\\nसदस्यों को भेजते हैं\\nध्यानाकर्षण प्रस्तावः स्पीकर की अनुमाति से लोकहित के मुझ्ों उठशने\\n\",\"document_image\":\"http://pbs.twimg.com/media/EsaZUr7XEAAOQIt.png?format=jpg&name=large\",\"document\":\"Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) MLA Mohammad Zama Khan is all set to join the JD(U) a few days after meeting the ruling party’s former state president and Rajya Sabha member, Vashishtha Narayan Singh, on January 18.  Congress legislator from Chenari, Murari Kumar Gautam, had also met Singh the same day. The Bihar Pradesh Congress Committee (BPCC) chief Madan Mohan Jha, however, does not attach much significance to Murari’s meeting with Singh, saying there was nothing objectionable in such meetings. A section of Congress leaders, on the other hand, believe that Murari’s meeting with the JD(U) leader could be viewed in the light of growing dissensions in the party.  A former MLA Bharat Singh had recently claimed that 11 out of Congress’ 19 MLAs were ready to join the National Democratic Alliance (NDA). Jha, however, strongly denied any fear of a spilt in the party, claiming that only ‘weak’ minds could think about it.  Ironically, several Congress MLAs had quit the party and joined the JD(U) just before the assembly elections a couple of months ago. Many party leaders believed that the new All India Congress Committee (AICC) in-charge for Bihar, Bhakta Charan Das, would have a difficult time revitalising the organisation in the face of factional feuds in the party and a fear of split. “As many as seven legislators out of the 19 did not turn up at the BPCC office when Das visited it for the first time as the in-charge.  There were only four MLAs, who took part in the Raj Bhawan march, taken out in support of agitating farmers on January 15, despite instructions from Das,” said a leader, who didn’t wish to be named. Many senior Congress leaders like former Lok Sabha speaker Meira Kumar and former governor Nikhil Kumar hardly visit Sadaquat Ashram—the BPCC headquarter—even on important occasions.  Former BPCC presidents Anil Sharma and Chandan Bagchi are often in news for their reservations. Senior leader and AICC member Kishore Kumar Jha said that the appointment of Das had bolstered the workers’ hope for the organisation’s rejuvenation. “Only elected leaders don’t make the organisation.  Senior leaders, who couldn’t get a chance to fight election or failed in electoral politics, shall also be given due importance for their role in strengthening the party’s roots.  Trusted leaders with credentials shall also be recognised and used in the organisation,” said Jha.

The AICC in-charge has proposed to undertake padyatra in several districts, including Vaishali, Muzaffarpur, Chapra, Siwan, East and West Champaran, Ara, Buxar, Gaya, Jehanabad, Arwal, etc, during his 12-day stay in the state.  Das is arriving in Patna on January 25 and will launch his campaign from January 27 after presiding over the Republic Day celebrations in the BPCC office.  He would wind up his first campaign in the state on February 6. \",\"document_ocr\":\"आदरणीय\\nश्री क्त चण दास\\nजी\\nहार्दिक स्वागत है।\\nकि\\n\",\"Category\":\"Insufficient_Text\"},{\"Id\":34994,\"claim_image\":\"http://pbs.twimg.com/media/EvJ7WV5UcAQuagc.jpg?format=jpg&name=large\",\"claim\":\"I respect EC's decision, but why break-up the districts.

Banerjee claimed that she was deliberately pushed by some people in Nandigram in East Midnapore hours after she filed her nomination from the assembly constituency on Wednesday. “Cowards have been trying to stop Mamata Banerjee but no one has been able to.  Firstly state ADG Law and Order was removed then DG and now with this. . .  I'm surprised to see how EC, who made all changes, is silent.  They must take responsibility,” Chatterjee, who also holds the state’s parliamentary affairs portfolio, told news agency ANI. The state minister’s remarks came hours after Banerjee claimed that she was pushed by four to five people while she was going to sit in her SUV, following which she also complained of chest pain.  She alleged that there were no local police at the spot.  Banerjee, who was unable to walk properly after the incident, was shifted by her security guards from the front seat to the back seat where she could rest her leg. The chief minister is currently admitted at the SSKM hospital in Kolkata where the doctor, cited by news agency PTI, said Banerjee has sustained severe bone injuries in her left ankle and foot.  Her right shoulder, forearm and neck were also injured, the senior doctor of the state-run SSKM hospital told PTI.  \\\"We will keep her under observation for the next 48 hours.  There will be more tests needed to be done, and after evaluating her condition we will decide on our next course of treatment,\\\" a doctor, part of the team treating Banerjee, was quoted as saying. The chief minister’s colleague and secretary general of West Bengal Trinamool Congress, Chatterjee told ANI that TMC leaders will visit the Election Commission office on Thursday regarding the incident.  “We (TMC party leaders) have decided that tomorrow we will go to the Election Commission and keep this matter in front of the constitutional authority,” he said. While the TMC minister has alleged inaction on EC’s part, the poll body has sought a report from the state police on the alleged attack, according to PTI. After the incident last evening, several TMC leaders alleged that the chief minister was being attacked by goons as many people, in an apparent reference to the opposition in the state, don't want her to campaign for the elections. “They want her to be removed from their path.  That is why she has been attacked by goons.  People will give a befitting reply,\\\" state minister and senior TMC leader Subrata Mukherjee was quoted by PTI. Meanwhile, the BJP termed it an accident and demanded a probe by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) as they alleged Banerjee was trying to turn it into \\\"pre-planned conspiracy,\\\" according to PTI. \\\"It can happen that she met with an accident but to claim that she was deliberately pushed is not acceptable.  She has a lot of security personnel guarding her round the clock,\\\" BJP's national general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya was quoted as saying. \",\"document_ocr\":\"\",\"Category\":\"Insufficient_Text\"},{\"Id\":34995,\"claim_image\":\"http://pbs.twimg.com/media/ExJgySlVEAYtBSJ.jpg?format=jpg&name=large\",\"claim\":\"Tamil Nadu: Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) chief MK Stalin holds door to door campaign in Krishnagiri.\\n\\nTamil Nadu to go to polls in single phase on April 6 https://t.co/YyJq5pysLq\",\"claim_ocr\":\"ANI\\nATHF FICKION\\n\",\"document_image\":\"http://pbs.twimg.com/media/EvSBqg8VEAQqaRO.png?format=jpg&name=large\",\"document\":\"Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra will visit Assam on Monday (March 1) to campaign for party candidates for upcoming Assembly election.

Two Indian flights carried two million doses of Covishield to Dhaka and one million doses to Kathmandu, and people familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity that supplies would be sent to Seychelles (50,000 doses), Mauritius (100,000 doses) and Myanmar (1. 5 million doses) on Friday. Seven countries – Bhutan, the Maldives, Bangladesh, Nepal, Seychelles, Myanmar and Mauritius – are part of India’s initial rollout of vaccines as grant assistance.  There are also plans to supply doses to Afghanistan and Sri Lanka. The people added commercial supplies of Covishield to several countries that have agreements with the Serum Institute of India will also begin from Friday.  Two flights will carry two million doses each to Brazil and Morocco early on Friday morning. After a phone conversation with his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi, Pakistan foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi announced on Thursday that Beijing had gifted 500,000 doses of the Sinopharm vaccine as aid. “I want to give the nation the good news that China has promised to immediately provide 500,000 doses of vaccine to Pakistan by January 31,” Qureshi said.  “They (China) have said you can send your airplane and immediately airlift this drug,”Qureshi quoted Wang as saying that Pakistan was the first country China thought of assisting with vaccines in view of their \\\"all-weather strategic relationship\\\".  He also said China would supply more than a million doses by February. Pakistan is currently the world’s most populous country that hasn’t rolled out a vaccination programme.  It is also the only country in the region to have approved the Sinopharm vaccine for emergency use.  The approval for Sinopharm earlier this week came days after Pakistan cleared the AstraZeneca vaccine. The two million doses gifted by India to Bangladesh were handed over by Indian envoy Vikram Doraiswami to foreign minister AK Abdul Momen and health minister Zahid Maleque in Dhaka.  This was the single largest consignment of vaccines provided by India to any country so far. Momen said India had stood by Bangladesh during the Liberation War of 1971 as well as the pandemic that had impacted the world.  “This proves the true friendship between Bangladesh and India,” he said. India’s vaccine assistance reached Nepal within a week of a request made by visiting Nepalese foreign minister Pradeep Gyawali during a visit to New Delhi last week.  While handing over the supplies to Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli in Kathmandu, Indian envoy Vinay Mohan Kwatra said this reflected “India’s Neighbourhood First policy in action”. Oli thanked Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the Indian government for the “generous grant of one million doses of Covid vaccine to Nepal at this critical time when India is rolling out vaccination for its own people”. Observers have noted that India speedily rolled out millions of doses as aid despite the massive requirements of its own vaccination drive that began on January 16.  The assistance came against the backdrop of China’s efforts to forge cooperation in fighting Covid-19 within South Asia by holding meetings with Pakistan, Afghanistan, Nepal, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh since last year. Former ambassador Vishnu Prakash lauded the alacrity with which the Indian government had responded to the needs of its neighbours, saying it was in line with its efforts to be the first responder in all emergency situations. “This is my definition of the Neighbourhood First policy.  It is the kind of policy and approach that we need to follow and its shows the difference between India and other countries.  I can’t think of such selflessness by any other country in an hour of need. ”Observers have noted that India speedily rolled out millions of doses as aid despite the massive requirements of its own vaccination drive that began on January 16.

If Trump blocked people in his personal capacity, “it is curious to me that the Justice Department is here representing him,” Judge Peter Hall said in response to the government’s attorney, Jennifer Utrecht. \\n\\n  “Your very presence here represents that this” – an apparent reference to Twitter – “is a public forum,” Hall added. \\n\\n  Utrecht said the department was representing the President because Trump had been sued in his official capacity. \\n\\n  Last year, a New York federal judge ruled that Trump had violated the Constitution when he blocked Twitter users.  \\n\\n  US District Judge Naomi Reice Buchwald wrote in her ruling that “no government official – including the President – is above the law, and all government officials are presumed to follow the law as has been declared. ” \\n\\n  “We hold that portions of the @realDonaldTrump account – the ‘interactive space’ where Twitter users may directly engage with the content of the President’s tweets – are properly analyzed under the ‘public forum’ doctrines set forth by the Supreme Court, that such space is a designated public forum, and that the blocking of the plaintiffs based on their political speech constitutes viewpoint discrimination that violates the First Amendment,” Buchwald wrote.  \\n\\n  On Tuesday, Utrecht argued that though Trump tweets in his official capacity, he blocks users as a personal matter.  Judge Christopher Droney listed recent tweets by the President, including one that revoked sanctions on North Korea, another concerning the Golan Heights territory and a third on the Federal Reserve Board.  \\n\\n  “Those aren’t official actions? ” the judge asked.  \\n\\n  Utrecht said they were, but later said: “The President, when he blocks individuals from his personal Twitter account … is doing so in his personal capacity. ” That prompted one judge to ask if Trump himself, rather than a personal aide or government staffer, is “entering the blocks. ” Utrecht replied that he is, an admission the government had also made in a stipulation.  \\n\\n  In his argument, Jaffer warned of a slippery slope if the court were to find that Trump could block certain users while occupying the White House.  \\n\\n  Raising the notion of a President preventing certain commenters from posting on a government website, Jaffer said, “I think you would be opening the door to the distortion and manipulation of those types of spaces as well if you were to accept this argument. ” \\n\\n  “The whole point of Twitter is to facilitate interaction among users,” he said.  “If the government had wanted one-way action, it could have used a blog” or another platform for Trump’s comments.  \\n\\n  CNN’s Kate Sullivan and Tom Kludt contributed to this report.  \\n© 2021 Cable News Network.

People above 60 years of age,who make up 10% of the country’s population, account for 50% of the 5,598 Covid-19 deaths recorded in India.  Of these, 38% belong to the 60 and 74 years age group.  Patients who were aged above 75 years old account for 12% of the deaths, the data shows.  The data that the ministry released on April 30 showed 34. 8% deaths were recorded in 45- 60 year age group.  “There is enough data being generated that people who are elderly (above 60 years of age), and those who suffer from some kind of underlying medical condition such as hypertension, diabetes or respiratory illness are at high risk and need to be extra careful as they are at a higher risk of developing severe form of disease,” said Lav Agarwal, joint secretary, health ministry, at a press briefing. According to the health ministry’s analysis of the deaths, 73% of the Covid deaths are of patients with underlying medical conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular and respiratory disease.  “This section of population needs to keep their symptoms under control by taking regular medicines, consulting their doctor on time, taking preventive measures such as not stepping out of the house, if not necessary, and wearing a mask, following hand hygiene etc. ,” Agarwal added.  In terms of deaths per 100,000 population, India has fatality rate 0. 41 as opposed to 4. 9 globally. “India’s death rate is probably the lowest in the world, and that is enough to speak for how the country has managed its cases far better than some of the most developed countries in the world.  Also, India’s case fatality rate has been steadily declining since past two months.  In mid April it was around 3. 3%, then it dropped to 3. 25%, later to 3. 15%, and as on today we stand at 2. 82%, even then we can’t let our guard drop, and taking precautions must be turned into a habit,” Agarwal said. “If you look at individual countries, some countries have even reported as high as 82 deaths per lakh population.  This says how our focus on early case detection, and robust contact tracing in containment zones has been in the right direction, and it will continue to be our main strategy in future also, along with ramping up the Covid testing capacity,” Agarwal added. Experts say focusing on the elderly and people suffering from non-communicable diseases (NCDs) is important as this section is more vulnerable to Covid-19. “People with major NCDs need regular care, and are likely to develop severe form of illness because of their co-morbid conditions, which is why we are working on reference guidelines for patients, doctors and other support staff to look for ways to reduce morbidity and mortality among this group, ” says Dr Prashant Mathur, director, The National Centre for Disease Informatics and Research (NCDIR).  India’s daily Covid testing capacity at the moment is about 140,000 samples; and the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) is aiming to scale it up to about 200,000 samples a day in the next two weeks. “In past two months our focus has been to scale up testing, and we have managed to go from about a 100 labs in March to about 681 functional laboratories currently, of which 476 are government labs and 205 are private testing labs.  Around the end of March we were doing about 20-25,000 samples in a day in India, and for the past few days the number on average is about 1. 20 lakh samples a day,” said Dr Nivedita Gupta, scientist (epidemiology division), ICMR. “There was shortage of supplies felt when we started out testing for Covid because there was a global demand for these supplies.  Today, we have managed to handhold many indigenous manufacturers who are capable producing kits in bulk.  We also use RT-PCR testing kits of at least 11-12 domestic manufacturers for testing, making us far more comfortable in terms of testing huge numbers in a short span of time than we were a few months ago,” she said. RT-PCR is short for Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction, known as the gold standard among Covid-19 tests. One of the private lab owners, on condition of anonymity, said, “It’s good to encourage indigenous manufacturers; however, we have to also ensure quality of products such as testing kits, swab sticks, viral transport medium that is being manufactured domestically.
